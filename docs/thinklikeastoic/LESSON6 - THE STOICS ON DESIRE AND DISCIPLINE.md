# LESSON 6

## THE STOICS ON DESIRE AND DISCIPLINE

According to Epictetus, a moral and serene life is attained if we train ourselves in three disciplines. The first, and the focus of this lesson, is learning to desire what is good for us and to be averse to what is bad for us. This lesson describes seven exercises on training our desires and aversions.

## DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL EXERCISE

The first exercise is about discovering what really is—and is not—up to us. Epictetus reminds us that what is truly up to us is limited to our deliberate thoughts, our decisions to act, and our endorsed values.

Among the things that are not up to us are external goods, from the health of our body to our reputation, wealth, and success in love or career. We can certainly influence such things, but we do not determine them.

To turn this insight into a regular exercise for everyday life, end the day by thinking over something important that happened to you that day. Do this before retiring for the evening. For instance, you may focus on a job review with your boss.

Then, open up a blank page and divide it into two sections. On the left, list all the things pertinent to that event that were under your complete control. On the right, list all the things that were not under your control.

> The structure for the next three lessons is taken from a book this course’s presenter cowrote with Greg Lopez, titled A Handbook for New Stoics: How to Thrive in a World Out of Your Control. In it, they present 52 exercises, divided into three groups corresponding to the disciplines of Epictetus.

In the case of the job review, some of the things up to you could include showing up on time, valuing your boss’s opinion and feedback, desiring to have a productive meeting, and whatever nervous thoughts you consciously told yourself.

Some things that were not up to you could include showing up on time (since you might have run into traffic or public transport delays), your boss’s opinion and feedback, actually meeting expectations, having a constructive meeting, and any automatic nervous thoughts that entered your mind.

The point of the exercise is to carefully and methodically apply Epictetus’s distinction between what is and is not up to you and gradually redirect your attention away from external outcomes and toward internal intentions. If you succeed, not only will you be more serene, but statistically speaking, you will be more likely to achieve those desired outcomes.

## CHARITABLE ATTITUDE EXERCISE

The Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius reminds us that we are imperfect and that we act—at 
least some of the time—from a misguided view of things. What we find blindingly obvious 
today we might have had trouble grasping in the past.

So, why not extend a courtesy to others and treat their misguided beliefs with charity? Perhaps we can persuade others to see things from a better perspective. And if not, maybe we can endure their lack of wisdom more easily if we keep in mind that we could be in their place instead.

For this exercise, reflect on someone whose behavior has annoyed you. Get a pen and paper and answer the following prompts as honestly and clearly as possible:

- What did the person do to annoy you?
- Why do you feel this amounts to a wrong against you?
- Why do you think they acted the way they did? What were they assuming to be true about the world that you think is incorrect?
- Have you ever held similar assumptions about the world or engaged in similar behaviors? If so, make a list.

The goal of the exercise is to gradually develop a more charitable attitude toward what you perceive as other people’s mistakes. That, in turn, should lead you toward less frustration and a more constructive approach to these kinds of interactions.

## SELF-DEPRIVATION EXERCISE

Modern Stoics engage in a number of exercises of mild self-deprivation as a way to remind ourselves to be thankful for what we might take for granted and to reset what modern psychologists call the hedonic treadmill.

The hedonic treadmill is the notion that we get used to new and exciting things. When this happens, we abandon the old and seek new thrills, only to find ourselves in the same psychological predicament shortly thereafter. One way to reset the hedonic treadmill is to purposefully deprive ourselves of certain things for a short period of time so that we 
might appreciate them anew.

There are many self-deprivation exercises. Here are a few examples that this course’s presenter practices.

- At least once a week, fast and abstain from alcohol. The next meal and sip of wine will be even more enjoyable after a day or two of abstaining.

- Take a cold shower. Keep in mind that hot water on demand was not available to most people throughout history and is still missing, or rare, in some parts of the world.

- Occasionally go out in the cold or rain while underdressed for inclement weather. This reminds you that there are plenty of people who cannot afford a proper coat and that perhaps you can do something to ameliorate their situation.

- Select a week every month when you will buy nothing other than basic necessities, such as food and toilet paper. Write down the specific parameters you’ve chosen, listing what you will do without, for how long, and according to what schedule.

The point is not to engage in self-flagellation but rather to engrain the notion that we can do without a lot of things we might have come to psychologically depend on. By doing so, we also nurture gratitude for the presence of things that make our lives more pleasant.

## PERSPECTIVE EXERCISE

The fourth exercise involves putting our troubles into a broader perspective and seeing them as less overwhelming than they might at first appear to be.

There are three approaches to this practice. In each one, begin by choosing a quiet spot and a moment without distraction. Close your eyes and conjure one of the three following scenarios.

- In the first, think of your present moment and begin a journey into the past. Zoom back a few decades to some specific event. Then move further back a few centuries, and then toward the beginning of human history, until you reach prehistory. Now, bring your mind 
  back to whatever was troubling you today. Do you still think it matters that much in the big scheme of things?
- In the second approach, put things in perspective by zooming out in space rather than in time. Begin by visualizing yourself in your current surroundings, then slowly move upward, looking at your building, your city, and finally the entire planet. Visualize the entire solar system, then the galaxy, and beyond. Now, quickly bring your mind back to contemplate your immediate problem. Does it still loom so large once you’ve examined things on a cosmic scale?
- Finally, think about your current problem—say, a job interview coming up—and compare it with other things people have had to face throughout history. Think about those who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, or lost a loved one, or experienced war and 
  destruction. Are you sure your job interview is that big of a deal?

Doing this sort of exercise isn’t meant to belittle your problems. But it helps to put things into a broader context—temporally, spatially, or by comparison with other people’s problems—to see your issue realistically and not be overwhelmed by it.

## CONNECTING WITH NATURE EXERCISE

The fifth exercise aims at reconnecting us with nature and nurturing an understanding of the fact that we are inextricably connected to the cosmic web of cause and effect. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote:

> The Pythagoreans bid us every morning lift our eyes to heaven, to meditate upon the heavenly bodies pursuing their everlasting round—their order, their purity, their nakedness. For no star wears a veil.

Every once in a while, remember to check the weather forecast for the following morning and, if it’s clear, set your alarm clock so that you can get out of bed before dawn and head to a spot that has a good view of the sunrise.

Get there with plenty of time to spare and with a cup of coffee and the passage of Meditations in hand. All you need to do is stand or sit there quietly and absorb the moment. After the sun has risen, reread the passage and then begin your day refreshed by a renewed acquaintance 
with nature.

Your imagination is the limit in terms of possible variants of this exercise. You could, for instance, spend a late evening looking at the starry sky, trying to spot meteorites, or engage purposefully in any other activity that has to do with nature, like hiking or kayaking. The important thing is to do it not just for recreational purposes but specifically as a meditation on your personal connection with nature.

## LABELING EXERCISE

The Stoics thought that there is only one thing that is truly good for us: our virtue, or our ability to arrive at correct, morally acceptable judgments. Conversely, there is only one thing that truly deserves to be called bad: our vice, which manifests itself any time we arrive at an incorrect, morally problematic judgment.

Everything else might have practical value—in which case it is labelled a preferred indifferent—or practical disvalue—in which case it is called a dispreferred indifferent. Indifferents are not things that we don’t care about but rather things that in themselves do not make us better or worse human beings. They are, in other words, morally neutral.

Today, we use the words good and bad liberally, attaching them to anything and everything: That was a good dinner! That was a really bad soccer game! So, this exercise consists of going through an entire day—or, better yet, an entire week—without using the words good and bad for anything other than your own judgments.

It comes so naturally to apply good or bad to almost everything, no matter how trivial, that you will catch yourself doing so a number of times. The underlying motive for this exercise is to reshape the way we automatically think about things, making us more parsimonious about applying labels to events, situations, and people.

## EATING EXERCISE

Eating, although fundamental for our survival and conducive to social intercourse, is a perfect time to exercise one of the four Stoic virtues: temperance. In practice, this means that every time you sit at the table, you should ask yourself the following:

- Am I eating more than is good for me?
- Am I eating too quickly, without savoring the food?
- Am I eating unhealthy foods?
- Am I serving my guests the same food, in the same portions, as myself?
- Is this a good time for a meal, or is there something more important I should be doing instead?

Going through these questions will not only make you a better Stoic; you’ll likely also be healthier and more welcome among your friends.

What is the discipline of desire?
Answer on page 181

# 第 6 课

## 关于欲望和纪律的斯多葛学派

根据爱比克泰德的说法，如果我们在三个学科中训练自己，就可以获得道德和宁静的生活。第一个，也是这节课的重点，是学习**渴望对我们有益的事物，反对对我们有害的事物。**本课描述了七个训练我们的欲望和厌恶的练习。

## 控制的二分法的练习

第一个练习是发现什么是真正由我们决定的，什么不是。爱比克泰德提醒我们，真正取决于我们的事情仅限于**我们深思熟虑的想法**、**我们采取行动的决定**和**我们认可的价值观**。

不取决于我们的是外在的东西，从我们的身体健康到我们的名誉、财富以及爱情或事业上的成功。我们当然可以影响这些事情，但我们不能决定它们。

要将这种洞察力转化为日常生活的常规练习，请通过思考当天发生在您身上的重要事情来结束这一天。在晚上退休之前这样做。例如，您可能会专注于与老板的工作检查。

然后，打开一个空白页并将其分成两个部分。在左侧，列出您完全控制的与该事件相关的所有事情。在右侧，列出所有不受您控制的事情。

> 接下来三节课的结构取自本课程的主持人与 Greg Lopez 共同编写的一本书，名为 A Handbook for New Stoics: How to Thrive in a World Out of Your Control。在其中，他们提出了 52 个练习，根据 Epictetus 的学科分为三组。

在工作检查的情况下，由你决定的一些事情可能包括准时出现、重视老板的意见和反馈、希望有一个富有成效的会议，以及你有意识地告诉自己的任何紧张想法。

一些不由你决定的事情可能包括准时出现（因为你可能会遇到交通或公共交通延误）、你老板的意见和反馈、实际达到期望、举行建设性会议以及任何自动进入的紧张想法你的想法。

这个练习的意义在于，仔细而系统地运用爱比克泰德(Epictetus)关于“什么由你决定”和“什么不由你决定”的区别，逐渐将你的注意力从外部结果转向内部意图。如果你成功了，你不仅会更平静，而且从统计上讲，你将更有可能达到预期的结果。

## 慈善态度练习

斯多葛学派的哲学家马可·奥勒留提醒我们，我们是不完美的，我们的行为——至少在某些时候——来自于对事物的错误看法。今天我们觉得非常明显的东西，过去我们可能很难理解。

那么，为什么不向他人表示礼貌，并以慈善的方式对待他们被误导的信仰呢？也许我们可以说服别人从更好的角度看待事情。如果不是这样，也许我们可以更容易地忍受他们缺乏智慧，只要我们记住，我们可以处于他们的位置（即我们也有可能会缺乏智慧）。

在这个练习中，反思一下哪个人的行为惹恼了你。拿起纸和笔，尽可能诚实、清楚地回答以下问题:

- 这个人做了什么惹恼了你？
- 为什么你觉得这对你不利？
- 你认为他们为什么这样做？他们对你认为不正确的世界的假设是什么？
- 你是否曾经对世界有过类似的假设或从事过类似的行为？如果有，请列一个清单。

练习的目标是逐渐对你认为别人的错误形成一种更仁慈的态度。反过来，这应该会引导你减少挫折感，并以更有建设性的方式来处理这些互动。

## 自我剥夺练习

现代斯多葛主义者进行了一些轻度自我剥夺的练习，以此来提醒自己感谢我们可能认为理所当然的事情，并重新设置现代心理学家所说的“享乐跑步机”（hedonic treadmill）。

享乐跑步机指的是我们习惯于新鲜刺激的事物。当这种情况发生时，我们就会抛弃旧的，寻求新的刺激，但不久之后就会发现自己陷入同样的心理困境。重置享乐跑步机的一种方法是有目的地在短时间内剥夺我们自己做某些事情的权利，这样我们也许会重新欣赏它们。

有许多自我剥夺练习。以下是本课程的演示者实践的一些示例。

- 至少每周一次，禁食并戒酒。戒酒一两天后，下一顿饭和一口酒会更加愉快。
- 洗个冷水澡。请记住，在整个历史上，大多数人都无法获得所需的热水，并且在世界某些地区，热水仍然缺乏或稀少。
- 偶尔在寒冷或下雨时外出，而在恶劣天气下穿着不足。这提醒你有很多人买不起一件合适的外套，也许你可以做点什么来改善他们的处境。
- 选择每个月的一周，除了基本必需品，例如食物和卫生纸，您什么都不买。写下您选择的具体参数，列出您将不做的事情、持续多长时间以及根据什么时间表。

关键不是要进行自我鞭笞，而是要让这样一种观念根深蒂固，即**我们可以在没有很多我们可能在心理上依赖的东西的情况下做到这一点**。通过这样做，我们**还培养了对使我们的生活更加愉快的事物的存在的感激之情。**

## 角度练习

第四种练习是把我们的麻烦放到更广阔的视野中，把它们看得不像乍看起来那么难以应付。

这个实践有三种方法。在每一个中，首先选择一个安静的地方和一个没有分心的时刻。闭上眼睛，想象以下三种情景之一。

- 首先，想想你现在的时刻，开始一段过去的旅程。回顾几十年的某些特定事件。然后再往前追溯几个世纪，然后走向人类历史的开端，直到你到达史前时期。现在，带着你的思想回到今天困扰你的事情。你仍然认为它在大计划中那么重要吗？
- 在第二种方法中，通过缩小空间而不是时间来透视事物。首先在你当前的环境中想象自己，然后慢慢向上移动，看看你的建筑、你的城市，最后是整个星球。可视化整个太阳系，然后是银河系，以及更远的地方。现在，迅速让你的思绪回想一下你眼前的问题。一旦你在宇宙尺度上审视事物，它是否仍然如此巨大？
- 最后，想想你当前的问题——比如即将到来的工作面试——并将它与人们在历史上不得不面对的其他事情进行比较。想想那些被诊断出患有绝症，或失去亲人，或经历过战争和破坏。你确定你的工作面试有那么重要吗？

做这种练习并不是要贬低你的问题。但它有助于将事情放在更广泛的背景下——时间上、空间上或与其他人的问题进行比较——现实地看待你的问题，而不是被它淹没。

## 与自然进行联系的练习

第五项练习旨在将我们与自然重新联系起来，并培养对**我们与宇宙因果网密不可分**的联系这一事实的理解。马库斯·奥勒留在他的《沉思录》中写道：

> 毕达哥拉斯学派每天早上都嘱咐我们举目仰望天堂，冥想那些追求永恒的天体——它们的秩序、它们的纯洁、它们的赤裸。因为没有星星戴着面纱。

每隔一段时间，记得查看第二天早上的天气预报，如果天气晴朗，请设置好闹钟，以便您可以在黎明前起床，前往可以欣赏到日出的地方。

到那里有足够的空闲时间，手拿一杯咖啡和这段《沉思录》的篇章。您需要做的就是安静地站或坐在那里，吸收这一刻。太阳升起后，再读一遍这篇文章，然后重新认识大自然，精神焕发地开始一天的生活。

你的想象力是这个练习可能变体的极限。例如，你可以花一个深夜看星空，试图发现陨石，或有目的地从事任何其他与自然有关的活动，如徒步旅行或皮划艇。重要的是，这样做不仅仅是为了娱乐，而是作为一种对你与自然的个人联系的冥想。

## 标记练习

斯多葛派认为只有一件事对我们真正有益：**我们的美德，或我们做出正确、道德上可接受的判断的能力。**相反，只有一件事真正值得被称为坏事：**我们的恶习，每当我们做出不正确的、道德上有问题的判断时，它就会显现出来。**

其他一切事物都可能具有实际价值——在这种情况下，它被标记为首选的冷漠——或实际的贬值——在这种情况下，它被标记为不偏好的冷漠。冷漠不是我们不关心的事情，而是那些本身不会使我们成为更好或更坏的人的事情。换句话说，它们在道德上是中立的。

今天，我们自由地使用“好”和“坏”这两个词，将它们附加到任何事物上：那是一顿美味的晚餐！那是一场非常糟糕的足球比赛！所以，这个练习包括经历一整天——或者更好的是，一整周——**除了你自己的判断之外，不使用“好”和“坏”这两个词。**

将好或坏应用于几乎所有事情是很自然的，无论多么微不足道，你都会发现自己这样做了很多次。这个练习的根本动机是重塑我们自动思考事物的方式，使我们在给事件、情况和人贴标签时更加节俭。

## 饮食练习

饮食，虽然对我们的生存至关重要，也有利于社会交往，但却是锻炼斯多葛派四大美德之一的最佳时机：节制。 在实践中，这意味着你每次坐在餐桌旁时，都应该问自己以下问题：

- 我吃得太多了吗？
- 我是不是吃得太快了，没有品尝食物？
- 我吃的食物不健康吗？
- 我是否为我的客人提供与我自己相同的食物、相同的份量？
- 现在是吃饭的好时间吗，还是我有更重要的事情要做?

问完这些问题不仅会让你成为一个更好的斯多葛派； 你也可能更健康，更受朋友欢迎。
