# LESSON 19

## MARCUS AURELIUS ON MANAGING TURMOIL

This lesson concludes our study of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations with an examination of the last four volumes. It then discusses two major philosophers who inspired Marcus: the pre-Socratic Heraclitus and the early 2nd-century Stoic Epictetus.

## CATASTROPHIZING

In the Meditations, Marcus expresses that things don’t come with labels as to whether they are good or bad, wonderful or catastrophic. Things just are. He then asks, “What is it, then, that passes judgment on them?”

He explains that humans are endowed with a ruling faculty that applies judgment to what we see happening. Our judgments aren’t necessarily correct, but we have the power to revise such conclusions. Marcus says he is able to cast out all his troubles because the trouble isn’t inherent in objective facts about the world but rather in his own subjective judgments about them.

The emperor wrote these words while fighting the Marcomanni and other German tribes on the northern frontier. How could it possibly be that a war against invading, determined, and well-armed tribes is not trouble?

Wars are a fact of human existence, especially in the time and place that characterized Marcus Aurelius’s life. Sometimes those wars went in favor of the Romans, and sometimes they didn’t. Marcus knew perfectly well that the situation he was facing was part of life and to be dealt with on its own terms. Better, therefore, to approach it with a serene mind rather than a mind stressed out by self-generated thoughts of catastrophe.

It’s a well-known principle of modern cognitive behavioral therapy that catastrophizing our problems—that is, indulging in dark, negative thinking about them—is unlikely to help solve a problem. It’s more likely to make it worse. Objective features of the world might trigger our debilitating doubts and negative judgments, but we also possess the power to revise our views and actually tackle whatever issue we face.

## SELF-IMPROVEMENT

We can act rationally to make the world a better place by being mindful about what sort of labels we want applied to ourselves. Marcus states this as follows:

- When you have assumed these names—good, modest, truthful, rational, a man of equanimity, and magnanimous—take care that you do not change these names; and if you should lose them, quickly return to them.

This is a classic Stoic mental exercise. Think about which attributes you would like to reflect your character and keep them in mind whenever you act. Should you discover through critical self-reflection that some of those labels don’t fit you well, make a concerted effort to redress the problem so that you can justifiably get back to thinking of yourself as someone who is good, modest, and truthful.

Near the end of book nine, Marcus gives a specific application of some of the qualities he wishes to cultivate. He writes:

- When you are offended at any man’s fault, immediately turn to yourself and reflect in what manner you yourself have erred: for example, in thinking that money is a good thing or pleasure, or a bit of reputation, and the like.

When someone offends us, it’s natural to turn self-righteous. Then we pause, think back to all those instances when we have done something of the same kind, and realize that we are hardly better than those we criticize. Perhaps we should be more magnanimous toward others and become more focused on improving ourselves.

## CASSIUS’S REBELLION

Marcus picks up the same theme at the beginning of book 11 of the
Meditations, when he writes:

- Shall any man hate me? That will be his affair. But I will be mild and benevolent toward every man, and ready to show even him his mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly.

He put this into practice during one of the most difficult moments of his reign: the rebellion of one of his generals, Gaius Avidius Cassius, in the year 175 CE. This occurred just as the emperor was preparing to wind down his defensive war against the Marcomanni tribe along the empire’s northern frontier.

Cassius heard a rumor that Marcus was dying, which became a serious threat to Marcus’s reign and the stability of the empire.* But Marcus’s response was measured and informed by the ideal of equanimity that he so often reminds himself to practice in the Meditations. He gave a reassuring speech to his troops and to the Roman Senate, and he assembled enough legions to counter the threat.

At the same time, he hoped to resolve his dispute with Cassius without bloodshed. As it happened, Cassius was killed by two of his own centurions. But afterward, Marcus asked the Senate to not engage in the usual revenge aimed at supporters of the revolt but instead to spare them or send them into exile.

> *The rumor might have been spread by Faustina, Marcus’s wife, to convince Cassius to rise up.

In this, Marcus was practicing the philosophy and discipline of a Stoic, even though he’d experienced a great personal threat and easily could have indulged in the sort of retribution typical of Roman emperors.

## IMPULSE

According to the Stoics, the key to ethical self-improvement is to constantly remind ourselves of what is the right thing to do. Marcus does exactly that in the 12th and final book of the Meditations, where he writes, “If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it. For let your impulse be in your own power.”

Impulse is a technical Stoic word with a rather different meaning from its modern English counterpart. It doesn’t indicate something we do without thinking, or yielding to temptation. Rather, impulse is the movement that initiates action once we’ve decided to do something.

Stoic impulse could be an automatic decision that we take without 
thinking, and it could result in yielding to some temptation that we 
might later regret. But Marcus’s point is that this doesn’t have to be the case. We can exercise a veto power on our impulses—think first and then see if it’s really a good idea.

We might be tempted to do something that is not right, or to say something that is not true. But either action would undermine what Stoics value most—our character—and why would we want to do that?

## HERACLITUS

Marcus refers to Heraclitus and Epictetus throughout his Meditations, sometimes quoting them explicitly.

From Heraclitus, Marcus draws the notion that the cosmos is characterized by reason: the logos. We are the only creatures in the universe that share in the logos, which means that we are the only rational animals. In a sense, this makes us not just special but close to divine.

However, privileged status comes with responsibilities. We have a duty to use reason to help not just ourselves but all humanity. By virtue of such participation, human beings are the only creatures to which the moral category applies because we are the only ones capable of deliberating and deciding on what appears to us as the best course of action.

A second theme of the Meditations derives from Heraclitus’s notion that change is a universal and inevitable characteristic of the world. He was famous for saying that we never step into the same river twice. Both we and the river are not static objects but dynamic processes.

Marcus infers an ethical injunction from this, where ethics is understood broadly as the study of how to lead one’s life. We must accept change, including when we are least inclined to, as in accepting our mortality and that of our loved ones.

It’s also clear throughout the Meditations that Marcus thinks most people don’t pay much attention to the deeper aspects of what’s going on—that we sort of sleepwalk through life. Heraclitus wrote: “Not comprehending, [people] hear like the deaf. The saying is their witness: absent while present.” But Marcus reminds himself that many people don’t want to actively commit evil; they simply lack wisdom. The proper approach toward rectification is first to try to teach them, and if that fails, to endure their mistakes.

Lastly, Heraclitus noted that the same thing can be either valuable or deadly depending on who is using it. He says, “The sea is the purest and foulest water: for fish drinkable and life-sustaining; for human beings undrinkable and deadly.”

Marcus dwells on similar examples but derives his own original lesson from them, writing, “Honey tastes bitter to a man with jaundice. People with rabies are terrified of water. And a child’s idea of beauty is a ball. Why does that upset you?”

That people have different perceptions and opinions about things should cause us no disturbance. If we agree with such opinions, all is well. But if we disagree, what is that to us?

## EPICTETUS

Marcus derives much of his practical ethics from a second influential source, Epictetus. For this ancient Greek philosopher, in turn, Socrates was the ultimate role model and paragon of virtue. Marcus shares Epictetus’s admiration for Socrates, mentioning the Athenian sage several times.

The use of ethical role models was an important part of ancient philosophical education. It was thought that one learns how to behave ethically by studying the examples of people who are worthy of our admiration.

Another theme Marcus takes from Epictetus is the notion that—as Christians would later put it—the flesh is weak, but the spirit can be strong. Epictetus suggested that we should identify our core being with our minds rather than our bodies. We share our bodily wants and instincts with other animals, but what really distinguishes us is our logos.

Marcus also embraces Epictetus’s attitude toward death. To die is natural, expected, and no real trouble. But while alive, we cannot allow other people to get in the way of us doing the right thing, which is using reason to help society.

The last big idea Marcus absorbs from Epictetus is the notion of life as theater, in which we all play a variety of roles. For Epictetus, our proper job as human beings is to perform these roles in the best way possible.

These roles are not to be played passively, as if we were marionettes in the hands of a puppet master, but rather with flexibility and a sense of duty. There are many ways to be a good human being, a good mother, a good son, or a good friend.

# 第 19 课

## 马库斯·奥勒留谈管理混乱

本课通过考察最后四卷来结束我们对马库斯·奥勒留的《沉思录》的研究。然后讨论了启发马库斯的两位主要哲学家：前苏格拉底的赫拉克利特和 2 世纪早期的斯多葛派爱比克泰德。

## **灾难化思考**（CATASTROPHIZING）

在《沉思录》中，马库斯表示，**事物没有好坏、美好或灾难的标签。事情就是这样。**然后他问：“那么，对他们作出判断的到底是什么？”

**他解释说，人类被赋予了一种支配能力，可以对我们所看到的事情进行判断。我们的判断不一定正确，但我们有权修正这样的结论。马库斯说他能够摆脱他所有的麻烦，因为这些麻烦不是与世界有关的客观事实所固有的，而是在他自己对它们的主观判断中。**

皇帝在北部边境与马尔科曼尼和其他德国部落作战时写下了这些话。与入侵、坚定、装备精良的部落的战争怎么可能不是麻烦呢？

战争是人类存在的事实，尤其是在马库斯·奥勒留生活的时间和地点。有时这些战争有利于罗马人，有时则不然。**马库斯非常清楚，他所面临的情况是生活的一部分，需要按照自己的方式处理。因此，最好以一颗平静的心去接近它，而不是一个被自我产生的灾难念头所压力的心。**

现代认知行为疗法的一个众所周知的原则是，灾难化我们的问题——也就是说，沉迷于对它们的黑暗、消极的思考——不太可能有助于解决问题。更有可能使情况变得更糟。世界的客观特征可能会引发我们衰弱的怀疑和负面判断，但我们也有能力修改我们的观点并实际解决我们面临的任何问题。

## 自我完善

我们可以理性地采取行动，通过注意我们想要给自己贴上什么样的标签，让世界变得更美好。马库斯这样说：

- 当你取了这些名字——善良、谦虚、真实、理性、冷静和大度——注意不要改变这些名字；如果你失去了它们，尽快回到它们身边。

**这是经典的斯多葛式心理锻炼。想想你想反映你的性格的哪些属性，并在你行动时牢记它们。**如果您通过批判性的自我反省发现其中一些标签并不适合您，请齐心协力解决问题，以便您可以合理地重新认为自己是一个善良、谦虚和诚实的人。

在接近第九章的结尾，马库斯给出了他希望培养的一些品质的具体应用。他写：

- 当你因任何人的过错而被冒犯时，立即回过头来反思自己犯了什么错误：例如，认为金钱是一件好事或乐趣，或一点名誉等等。

当有人冒犯我们时，很自然地会变得自以为是。然后我们停下来，回想一下我们做过类似事情的所有那些例子，并意识到我们并不比那些我们批评的人好。或许我们应该对他人更加宽宏大量，更加专注于提升自己。

## 卡修斯的叛乱

马库斯在《沉思录》第11卷的开头也提到了同样的主题，他写道:

- 会有人恨我吗？那将是他的事。但我会对每个人都温和而仁慈，并准备向他表明他的错误，不是责备，也不是在展示我的忍耐，而是高尚而诚实。

他在他统治时期最困难的时刻之一实践了这一点：公元 175 年，他的一位将军 Gaius Avidius Cassius 的叛乱。这发生在皇帝正准备结束对帝国北部边境的马科曼尼部落的防御战时。

卡修斯听到传言说马库斯快死了，这对马库斯的统治和帝国的稳定构成了严重威胁。* 但马库斯的反应是根据他经常提醒自己在冥想中练习的平静理想来衡量和告知的。他向他的部队和罗马元老院发表了令人放心的演讲，并召集了足够多的军团来应对威胁。

同时，他也希望在没有流血的情况下解决自己与卡修斯的争端。碰巧的是，卡修斯被自己的两个百夫长杀死。但后来，马库斯要求参议院不要对起义的支持者进行通常的报复，而是要饶恕他们或将他们流放。

> *这个谣言可能是马库斯的妻子福斯蒂娜散布的，目的是说服卡修斯起义。

在这方面，马库斯正在实践斯多葛派的哲学和纪律，尽管他经历了巨大的个人威胁，很容易就会沉迷于罗马皇帝典型的报复。

## 冲动

根据斯多葛学派的说法，道德修养的关键是不断提醒自己什么是正确的事情。马库斯在《沉思录》的第 12 卷也是最后一本书中正是这样做的，他在其中写道：“**如果不对，就不要这样做；如果不正确，就不要说。因为让你的冲动在你自己的力量之下。**”

Impulse 是一个技术性的斯多葛主义词汇，其含义与现代英语对应物完全不同。它并不表示我们不假思索地做某事，或屈服于诱惑。相反，**冲动是我们决定做某事后开始行动的运动。**

斯多葛派的冲动可能是我们不经思考就做出的自动决定，它可能导致我们屈服于某些诱惑，然后我们可能会后悔。但马库斯的观点是，情况不一定如此。我们可以对我们的冲动行使否决权——先想想，然后看看这是不是一个好主意。

我们可能会试图做一些不正确的事情，或者说一些不正确的事情。但任何一种行动都会破坏斯多葛派最看重的东西——我们的性格——我们为什么要这样做？

## 赫拉克利特

马库斯在他的《沉思录》中都提到了赫拉克利特和爱比克泰德，有时还明确引用了他们。

从赫拉克利特那里，马库斯得出了宇宙以理性为特征的概念：逻各斯（Logos）。我们是宇宙中唯一共享理性的生物，这意味着我们是唯一理性的动物。从某种意义上说，这不仅使我们特别，而且使我们接近于神圣。

然而，特权地位伴随着责任。我们有责任利用理性来帮助我们自己和全人类。由于这种参与，人类是唯一适用道德范畴的生物，因为我们是唯一能够审议和决定在我们看来是最佳行动方案的人。

《沉思录》的第二个主题源自赫拉克利特的观念，即变化是世界普遍且不可避免的特征。他以说我们从不两次踏入同一条河流而闻名。我们和河流都不是静态的物体，而是动态的过程。

马库斯由此推断出道德禁令，道德被广泛理解为对如何过自己的生活的研究。我们必须接受改变，包括在我们最不愿意改变的时候，比如接受我们的死亡和我们所爱的人的死亡。

纵观《沉思集》，我们也清楚地看到，马库斯认为大多数人都不太关注正在发生的事情的深层方面——我们在生活中梦游。赫拉克利特写道:“没有理解，人们听起来就像聋子。这句话是他们的见证:在场时不在。”但马库斯提醒自己，很多人并不想主动作恶;他们就是缺乏智慧。纠正的正确方法首先是教育他们，如果失败了，就容忍他们的错误。

最后，赫拉克利特指出，同样的东西可能是有价值的，也可能是致命的，这取决于使用它的人。他说：“海是最纯净、最肮脏的水：鱼可以饮用和维持生命；对人类来说是不可饮用和致命的。”

马库斯详述了类似的例子，但从这些例子中汲取了他自己的原始教训，写道：“对于患有黄疸的人来说，蜂蜜尝起来很苦。狂犬病患者怕水。孩子对美的看法是一个球。为什么这会让你心烦意乱？”

人们对事物有不同的看法和意见不应该给我们造成干扰。如果我们同意这样的意见，一切都很好。但如果我们不同意，那对我们有什么影响？

## 爱比克泰德

马库斯的大部分实践伦理来自第二个有影响力的来源——爱比克泰德。反过来，对于这位古希腊哲学家来说，苏格拉底是美德的终极榜样和典范。马库斯和爱比克泰德一样钦佩苏格拉底，多次提到这位雅典圣人。

道德榜样的使用是古代哲学教育的重要组成部分。人们认为，通过研究值得我们钦佩的人的例子来学习如何道德行事。

马库斯从爱比克泰德那里得到的另一个主题是——正如基督徒后来所说的——肉体是软弱的，但精神可以是强壮的。 Epictetus建议我们应该用我们的思想而不是我们的身体来识别我们的核心存在。我们与其他动物分享我们的身体需求和本能，但真正让我们与众不同的是我们的徽标。

马库斯也接受爱比克泰德对死亡的态度。死是自然的，意料之中的，没有真正的麻烦。但是在活着的时候，我们不能让其他人妨碍我们做正确的事情，那就是用理性来帮助社会。

马库斯从爱比克泰德那里吸收的最后一个重要思想是将生活作为戏剧的概念，在其中我们都扮演着各种各样的角色。对于 Epictetus，我们作为人类的正确工作是以最好的方式形成这些角色。

这些角色不能被动地扮演，好像我们是傀儡师手中的提线木偶，而是要有灵活性和责任感。 有很多方法可以成为一个好人、一个好母亲、一个好儿子或一个好朋友。
