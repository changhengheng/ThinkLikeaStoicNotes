# LESSON 1

HOW TO LIVE LIKE A STOIC SAGE

This lesson explores the main ideas of Stoic philosophy and explains why it became one of the dominant philosophical schools of antiquity. It also introduces how to practice Stoicism and why the philosophy is so relevant to life today.

## ZENO’S SHIPWRECK

More than 2,000 years ago, a Phoenician merchant named Zeno of Citium\* was on board a merchant ship sailing in the Aegean Sea near Athens. The ship encountered a powerful storm and sunk with all of its cargo and many men aboard. But Zeno survived, making it ashore and arriving at Athens.

Once he recovered from the shock of this experience, he went to a bookshop, where he listened to the Memorabilia being read aloud. This is a composition written by the Greek statesman and writer Xenophon about the famous Athenian philosopher Socrates.

Zeno was so fascinated that he resolved then and there to study philosophy. He turned to the bookseller and asked, “Where can I find a philosopher?” The bookseller looked out onto the street and said, “There goes one!” The philosopher in question was Crates of Thebes. And Zeno became his student.

After a few years of studying with a number of other teachers, Zeno felt ready to begin his own school of practical philosophy, which became known as Stoicism.

The basic ideas of Stoicism are rooted in Zeno’s experience during and after the shipwreck, as well as in what he learned by studying philosophy as taught by other schools:
❙ We do not control as much as we think we do about the world and ur lives, as the sudden shipwreck demonstrated.  
 ❙ We can recover from disasters by focusing on what is in our power, like Zeno changing his profession from merchant to philosopher.  
 ❙ Following the example of Socrates, the most important thing in life is to live by the light of reason as a good member of the human community, rather than to pursue wealth and fame.

## VIRTUE ETHICS

While standard ethics is focused on answering questions about actions (things like “Is abortion right or wrong?” or “Is human cloning right or wrong?”), virtue ethics, by contrast, focuses on our character. It asks, “How can I become a better person?”

Aristotle practically invented the approach of virtue ethics as it is understood in the West today. He thought that a eudaimonic life—that is, a life worth living—is one in which we try to become the best humans we can be. But he also contended that such a life requires many things that are not under our control, such as wealth, education, health, and even beauty.

Epicurus, in contrast, thought that the most important things in life were the pursuit of simple pleasures and the avoidance of pain, both physical and emotional. So, the Epicurean life consists of spending a lot of time with friends, reading and debating, all while accompanied by food and wine.

Stoicism is another type of virtue ethics, alongside Aristotelianism and Epicureanism. Indeed, the Stoics were major rivals of the two, and of other schools throughout the Hellenistic period. This is an ancient philosophy born of the need of a Phoenician merchant who was trying to process losing all he had after barely surviving a shipwreck. A sound philosophy of life can change your outlook for the better, as it did for Zeno of Citium.

## THE PREMISE OF STOICISM

Distilled to its essence, Stoicism is a philosophy of personal betterment that puts an emphasis on living reasonably and pro-socially and provides emotional ballast against the vicissitudes of fortune and pain alike. Ultimately, Stoicism teaches us to govern our lives from within, according to our own moral compass, rather than being pushed around by external forces and factors.

More formally, Stoic philosophy is founded on one crucial premise and relies on two fundamental pillars to provide practical guidance through one’s life.

The premise is to live according to nature. The Stoics figured that if the problem we’re facing is how to live a life worth living, then we should take seriously what sort of animal human beings actually are. Two ideas, according to the Stoics, are so important that we might want to organize our entire existence around them: We are capable of reason, and we are inherently social animals.

A capacity for reason doesn’t mean that we are always reasonable, of course. And being social doesn’t mean we cannot live in isolation. Instead, it means that we thrive in a social group, pursuing projects that are made possible by the fact that we live in a society.

From these two observations, the Stoics concluded that a life well lived is one in which we deploy reason for the improvement of society. Living according to nature means using our brains, as imperfect as our brains are, to make life on this planet better for everyone, and therefore for ourselves.

## THE FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES

We can achieve living a life well lived by relying on the two pillars of Stoic philosophy: the four cardinal virtues and the dichotomy of control.

Improving society, according to the Stoics, isn’t something that can be done from the top down—by imposing some kind of utopia on people who might or might not like your view of how things should be run. Instead, the world changes one person at a time, from the bottom up. And the only person you can change is yourself.

This positive personal change comes about by constantly practicing four virtues, or habits. They are practical wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. - Practical wisdom tells us the difference between what we can and cannot change. - Courage is not just physical but first and foremost moral: the courage to stand up and do the right thing. - Justice tells us the right thing to do. - Temperance is the notion that we should do things in the right measure, neither overreacting to situations nor failing to do enough to correct things.

What if your coworker is being harassed by the boss? Practical wisdom tells you that this is a situation where you can intervene. You might not be able to change your boss’s attitude, but you may be able to improve the culture at your workplace and comfort your coworker. Justice, then, lies in standing up to the boss. Courage is what gives you the strength to do it. And temperance keeps your response to the boss within reasonable and useful limits.

## THE DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL

The second pillar of Stoic philosophy—the dichotomy of control—was famously summarized by the slave-turned-teacher Epictetus at the beginning of his manual for a good life, The Enchiridion.

While we can influence our body, property, reputation, and office, ultimately, they’re not under our power. Even the healthiest body can be struck by disease or accident. Your property can be taken away from you for a number of reasons. And your reputation can be ruined through gossip and other people’s malicious intent.

In contrast, opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and other things of our own doing might be influenced by others, but they ultimately are our own responsibility. Other people might try to get you to change your judgments and opinions or make you adopt a different set of values, but the buck, so to speak, stops with you.

If you take the dichotomy of control to heart, you’ll change your entire outlook on life. You’ll no longer concern yourself with the outcomes of your decisions but instead with their soundness. The outcome is not up to you, but the decision to do certain things rather than others certainly is.

The Roman writer Cicero explained the Stoic position by considering an archer who is trying to hit a target. The archer can decide how assiduously to practice, which arrows and bow to select, and how to care for them. They also control their focus right up the moment they let go of the arrow. But once the arrow leaves the bow, nothing at all is under the archer’s control. A sudden gust of wind might deflect the best shot, or the target—say, an enemy soldier—might suddenly move.

Hitting the target is what you’re after, so it’s what you pursue. But success or failure does not, in and of itself, make you a good or bad archer. This means that you should not attach your self-worth to the outcome but only to the attempt. Then, you will achieve what the ancients called ataraxia: the kind of inner tranquility that results from knowing you’ve done everything that was in your power to do.

## ROLE ETHICS

Another way to understand and practice Stoic philosophy is through what’s known as role ethics. The idea is that we all play a variety of roles in our lives—father, son, mother, daughter, boss, employee, and so forth—and that a life worth living involves balancing those roles in the most harmonious way possible.

According to Epictetus, there are fundamentally three kinds of roles: our basic role as human beings and members of the human cosmopolis; roles that are given to us by circumstances, such as being someone’s daughter or son; and roles that we choose for ourselves, such as by having children or being someone’s friend.

The Stoics think that our role as a member of the human cosmopolis is the most important one. Ultimately, we need to work in concert to make sure that we provide a better present for all and a better future for coming generations.

Within that broad guideline, we then need to balance all of our specific roles the best way possible. That will often entail compromises. How much of a compromise should you make, say, when you contemplate the simultaneous demands of your professional and family lives? This ties back to the cardinal virtues.

The ancient Stoics had a trick to improving our character: the use of role models. They came up with a gallery of real and fictional role models whose virtues they used to straighten our crooked character.

One of the most famous of these was Cato the Younger, who gave his life to oppose what he perceived as the tyranny of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Another was the mythical Odysseus, who endured 10 years of hardship and turned down the offer of immortality—twice—
in order to come back home to his wife and son. And, of course, there is Socrates, whose philosophy inspired the Stoics, and whose death at the hands of the state made him the first martyr to the cause of wisdom.

# 第 1 课

## 如何像斯多葛学派的圣人一样生活

本课探讨斯多葛哲学的主要思想，并解释为什么它成为古代占主导地位的哲学流派之一。它还介绍了如何实践斯多葛主义，以及为什么这种哲学与当今的生活如此相关。

## 芝诺的沉船

2000 多年前，一位名叫芝诺的腓尼基商人乘坐一艘商船在雅典附近的爱琴海航行。这艘船遇到了一场强大的风暴，船上所有的货物和许多人都沉没了。但是芝诺幸存下来，上了岸并到达了雅典。

等他从这次经历的震惊中恢复过来后，他去了一家书店，在那里他听着人们大声朗读《大事记》。这是希腊政治家、作家色诺芬写的一篇关于雅典著名哲学家苏格拉底的作品。

芝诺非常着迷，以至于他当时就决定在那里学习哲学。他转向书商问道：“我在哪里可以找到哲学家？”书商望着街上说：“有一个！”这位哲学家就是底比斯的克拉特斯。芝诺成了他的学生。

在与其他一些老师一起学习了几年之后，芝诺觉得自己已经准备好开办自己的实践哲学学校，这就是斯多葛学派。

斯多葛主义的基本思想植根于芝诺在海难期间和之后的经历，以及他通过学习其他学校所教授的哲学所学到的东西：

- 我们对世界和我们的生活的控制并不像我们认为的那么多，就像突然发生的海难所证明的那样。
- 我们可以通过专注于我们力所能及的事情来从灾难中恢复，就像芝诺把他的职业从商人变成了哲学家一样。
- 效法苏格拉底，人生最重要的事，是作为人类社会的好成员，在理性的光芒下生活，而不是追求名利。

## 美德伦理

标准伦理学侧重于回答有关行为的问题（例如“堕胎是对还是错？”或“克隆人是对还是错？”），而美德伦理学则侧重于我们的性格。它问：“我怎样才能成为一个更好的人？”

**亚里士多德实际上发明了当今西方所理解的美德伦理学方法。他认为，幸福的生活——也就是值得过（有价值）的生活——是我们努力成为最好的人的生活。**但他也认为，这样的生活需要很多我们无法控制的东西，比如财富、教育、健康，甚至美丽。

相比之下，伊壁鸠鲁认为生活中最重要的事情是追求简单的快乐和避免身体和情感上的痛苦。因此，伊壁鸠鲁式的生活包括与朋友共度大量时间、阅读和辩论，同时伴随着美食和美酒。

斯多葛主义是另一种美德伦理学，与亚里士多德主义和伊壁鸠鲁主义并列。事实上，斯多葛派是两者的主要竞争对手，也是整个希腊化时期其他学派的主要竞争对手。这是一个古老的哲学，源于一位腓尼基商人的需要，他在几乎没有幸免于海难后试图处理失去的一切。**一个健全的人生哲学可以改变你的前景，就像它对芝诺所做的那样。**

## 斯多葛学派的前提

从本质上来说，**斯多葛主义是一种个人改善的哲学，强调合理地、亲社会地生活，并提供情感上的安定，以抵御命运和痛苦的变迁。**最终，斯多葛主义教我们**根据自己的道德指南从内部管理我们的生活，而不是被外部力量和因素左右。**

更正式地说，**斯多葛哲学建立在一个关键前提之上，并依靠两个基本支柱来为一个人的一生提供实践指导。**

**前提是根据自然生活。斯多葛派认为，如果我们面临的问题是如何过上值得过（有价值）的生活，那么我们应该认真对待（考虑）人类到底是什么样的动物。根据斯多葛派的说法，有两个想法非常重要，以至于我们可能想围绕它们组织我们的整个存在：我们有推理能力，我们天生就是社会动物。**

当然，理性的能力并不意味着我们总是理性的。社交并不意味着我们不能孤立地生活。相反，它意味着我们在一个社会群体中茁壮成长，追求那些因为我们生活在一个社会中而成为可能的项目。

从这两个观察中，斯多葛派得出结论，过上好的生活是我们**为改善社会而运用理性**的生活。根据自然生活意味着使用我们的大脑（尽管我们的大脑并不完美）让这个星球上的生活对每个人都更好，因此对我们自己也更好。

## 四项基本美德

依靠斯多葛哲学的两大支柱：四项基本美德和控制的二分法，我们可以过上美好的生活。

根据斯多葛派的说法，改善社会不是一件可以自上而下完成的事情——通过将某种乌托邦强加给那些可能喜欢也可能不喜欢你对事情应该如何运作的看法的人。相反，世界一次改变一个人，自下而上。而**你唯一能改变的人就是你自己。**

这种积极的个人改变是通过不断练习四种美德或习惯来实现的。它们是**实践的智慧、勇气、正义和节制**。

- 实践智慧告诉我们可以改变的和不能改变的之间的区别。
- 勇气不仅是身体上的，而且首先是道德上的：勇敢站起来做正确的事。
- 正义告诉我们做正确的事。
- 节制是我们应该以正确的方式做事的概念，既不要对情况反应过度，也不要在纠正事情上做的不够。

如果你的同事被老板骚扰怎么办？实践智慧告诉你，这是你可以干预的情况。您可能无法改变老板的态度，但您可能能够改善工作场所的文化并安慰您的同事。那么，正义就在于站在老板面前。勇气是你做这件事的力量。节制使你对老板的反应保持在合理和有用的范围内。

## 控制二分法

斯多葛哲学的第二个支柱——控制的二分法——由奴隶出身的教师爱比克泰德在他的美好生活手册《Enchiridion》的开头作了著名的总结。

虽然我们可以影响我们的身体、财产、名誉和职位，但最终，它们不受我们的控制。即使是最健康的身体也会被疾病或意外袭击。出于多种原因，您的财产可能会被从您手中夺走。而且你的名声可能会因为八卦和其他人的恶意而毁掉。

相比之下，我们自己所做的意见、动机、欲望、厌恶和其他事情可能会受到他人的影响，但最终它们是我们自己的责任。其他人可能会试图让你改变你的判断和观点，或者让你采用不同的价值观，但可以说，责任不在于你。

如果您牢记控制的二分法，您将改变整个人生观。**你将不再关心你的决定的结果，而是关心它们的合理性。结果不取决于你，但做某些事情而不是其他事情的决定肯定是。**

罗马作家西塞罗通过考虑一个试图击中目标的弓箭手来解释斯多葛派的立场。射手可以决定练习的刻苦程度，选择哪些箭和弓，以及如何照顾它们。他们还可以在放箭的那一刻控制自己的注意力。但一旦箭离开弓，弓手就完全无法控制。突如其来的一阵风可能会使最佳射击偏转，或者目标（例如，敌方士兵）可能会突然移动。

达到目标是你所追求的，所以这就是你所追求的。但成功或失败本身并不能决定你是一个好还是坏的弓箭手。这意味着**你不应该把你的自我价值附加到结果上，而应该只附加到尝试上。然后，你将达到古人所说的心神不宁：一种内心的平静，因为你知道你已经做了你力所能及的一切。**

## 角色伦理学

理解和实践斯多葛哲学的另一种方式是通过所谓的角色伦理学。这个想法是，我们都在生活中扮演着各种各样的角色——父亲、儿子、母亲、女儿、老板、员工等等——而**有价值的生活需要以尽可能最和谐的方式平衡这些角色。**

根据爱比克泰德，基本上有三种角色：我们作为人类的基本角色和人类世界大都会的成员；环境赋予我们的角色，例如某人的女儿或儿子；以及我们为自己选择的角色，例如生孩子或成为某人的朋友。

斯多葛派认为我们作为人类世界大都会的一员的角色是最重要的。最终，我们需要齐心协力，确保我们为所有人提供更好的当下，为子孙后代提供更美好的未来。

在这一宽泛的指导方针内，我们需要以最佳方式平衡我们所有的具体角色。这往往需要妥协。例如，当您考虑职业和家庭生活的同时要求时，您应该做出多少妥协？这与基本美德有关。

古代斯多葛学派有一个**改善我们性格的诀窍：使用榜样。**他们想出了一系列真实和虚构的榜样，用他们的美德来纠正我们扭曲的性格。

其中最著名的之一是小加图，他献出生命来反对他认为的罗马独裁者朱利叶斯·凯撒的暴政。另一个是神话中的奥德修斯，他忍受了 10 年的艰辛和拒绝了永生的提议——两次——为了回到他的妻子和儿子的家。当然，还有苏格拉底，他的哲学启发了斯多葛派，他死于国家之手，使他成为智慧事业的第一个殉道者。
