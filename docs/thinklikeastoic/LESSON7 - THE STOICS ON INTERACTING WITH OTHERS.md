# LESSON 7

## THE STOICS ON INTERACTING WITH OTHERS

The second of Epictetus’s three disciplines for a better life is action, which says that we should interact with other people as human beings worthy of the same respect that we wish to be accorded. Each exercise in this lesson begins with a pertinent quote from one of the ancient Stoics, followed by suggestions on how to practice the principle.

## PEACE OF MIND EXERCISE

The first exercise is inspired by the following passage from Epictetus, where he talks about the typical 1st-century Roman experience of going to the public baths:

- When you are about to take something in hand, remind yourself what manner of thing it is. If you are going to bathe, put before your mind what happens in the bath—water pouring over some, others being jostled, some reviling, others stealing; and you will set to work more securely if you say to yourself at once: “I want to bathe, and I want to keep my will in harmony with nature,” and so in each thing you do. For in this way, if anything turns up to hinder you in your bathing, you will be ready to say, “I did not want only to bathe,but to keep my will in harmony with nature, and I shall not so keep it, if I go to pieces every time someone splashes some water on me.”

If you know you’re likely to encounter a frustrating situation, take a minute to visualize it in your mind before you get started. Second, mentally rehearse something like “I want to do this, but I also want to keep my harmony with nature.” Third, visualize yourself behaving calmly under the circumstances.

Research shows that this technique works in part because when we simulate something in our mind, we activate the same neural pathways that are turned on in the brain when we do the actual thing. It’s almost like the brain evolved precisely to help us preempt problems before they occur.

## TIME EXERCISE

In On the Shortness of Life, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca writes

- You will hear many of those who are burdened by great prosperity cry out at times in the midst of their throngs of clients, or their pleadings in court, or their other glorious miseries: “I have no chance to live.” Of course you have no chance! All those who summon you to themselves, turn you away from your own self. … Check off, I say, and review the days of your life. … Everyone hurries his life on and suffers from a yearning for the future and a weariness of the present. But he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.

In ancient Rome, life was just as cluttered with distractions and useless things to do as in the 21st century. The Stoic take begins with the observation that human life is finite, and how we use our time is crucially important.

For this exercise, set aside a few minutes at the end of your day and draw up a table with three columns. The first will contain some activity you’ve done. The second column will answer the question of whether you think that activity made you a better person or fulfilled an important role. The last column will answer the question of would you do this on your last day of life.

Fill out the table and then take stock. How many things were fulfilling or important? How many would you do on your last day? If an activity didn’t make it into the second or the third column, you might want to reexamine its worth and whether you want to remain committed to it.

## SMALL TALK EXERCISE

To begin the third exercise, here is a simple yet difficult-to-implement suggestion from Epictetus in The Enchiridion:

- Be silent for the most part, or, if you speak, say only what is necessary and in a few words. Talk, but rarely, if occasion calls you, but do not talk of ordinary things, of gladiators, or horse races, or athletes, or of meats or drinks—these are topics that arise everywhere—but above all do not talk about men in blame or compliment or comparison.

Maybe you aren’t particularly tempted to talk about gladiators these days, but the other things Epictetus lists still make up much small talk as engaged in at the office, at parties, or with close friends and family. We tend to talk too much, and yet much of the time we don’t say a lot that is actually worth paying attention to. So, the first notion is to curb our enthusiasm for talking irrespective of the quality of our speech.

In order to practice this exercise, you will have to engage in two steps.

First, write a list of things that you tend to talk too much about so that you will be aware of what topics you need to avoid. Having the list will help you catch yourself before you start going on and on about gladiators and such.

Second, make a mental note to silently recite an effective reminder whenever you catch yourself speaking of things from your list. For instance, if you notice that you have a tendency to gossip when you get together with a particular friend, tell yourself ahead of time that when you see Mark, you will silently tell yourself not to gossip.

One difficulty you’ll likely encounter is that you’ll feel a strong psychological pressure to say something in a social situation to avoid embarrassing silences. But pause and ask yourself: What is embarrassing about silence? Is it really better to open your mouth and talk at random rather than to sit quietly and listen to others, or even to the sound of silence?

## VIRTUE EXERCISE

The fourth exercise is also based on Epictetus’s Enchiridion:

- Refuse the entertainments of strangers and the vulgar. But if occasion arise to accept them, then strain every nerve to avoid lapsing into the state of the vulgar. For know that, if your comrade have a stain on him, he that associates with him must needs share the stain, even though he be clean in himself.

What Epictetus means by “the vulgar” is people who are not good influences. The point is a serious one, and it’s backed up by modern empirical research. If we want to become better human beings, we need to stay away from people who reinforce our bad habits and instead expose ourselves to the company of those who will help us improve by way of their example.

In practical terms, here’s how you can do this exercise. Create a table with four columns.

The first column will contain your list of people who might not be good for your virtue, so to speak.

In the second column, write down which specific behaviors or moods you’d like to avoid and that you’ve noticed are associated with particular individuals. Let’s say, for instance, that you’re trying to reduce the amount of gossip you engage in, and yet your friend Mark really loves gossiping.

> Suppose you’re trying to kick a smoking habit. Do you think this is more likely to happen if you hang out with other smokers, or if you spend time with people who have quit already and are trying to stick with their new healthy habit?

In the third column, ask yourself whether it’s possible to reduce your exposure to Mark without avoiding your social responsibilities. Maybe Mark is a close friend of your partner, for instance, or he’s a relative.That means you can’t just avoid him, though you might still be able to figure out ways to reduce your exposure.

The last column will contain your plan on how to reduce your exposure to Mark. And if that can’t be done, it will contain a positive reminder that—Mark or no Mark—you really want to avoid gossiping.

Remember, you are not doing this in order to become a snob, but to improve as a member of the human cosmopolis. And modern science shows that it actually works!

## INSULT EXAMPLE

In The Enchiridion, Epictetus says

- If someone tells you that so and so speaks ill of you, do not defend yourself against what he says, but answer, “He did not know my other faults, or he would not have mentioned these alone.”

From a Stoic’s perspective, insults are a complete waste of emotional resources. Concerning the content of the perceived insult, there are only two possibilities at play: Either the person in question is right in criticizing you, or they aren’t. If they’re right—no matter how rudely 
they might have expressed the criticism—the rational thing for you to do is thank them for pointing out something you need to work on. If they’re wrong, the joke is on them, since they’re the one making a mistake.

All you can control is your reaction to the perceived insult. In the passage, Epictetus suggests reacting with a bit of humor, which is great if you can muster it. Yet eliciting a reaction is precisely what someone wants when they insult you. If you just walk away, they will
be the one feeling stupid or enraged. That, of course, is their problem, not yours.

To put this insight into action, the obvious thing is to deploy some of the techniques you’ve already learned, like thinking ahead about possible delicate situations and simulating in your mind how you will react.

Remember, a prepared mind handles problems far better than a mind that is caught off guard. But if the situation arises unexpectedly, you will try to channel your inner Epictetus and do the simplest thing of them all: walk away. You will then feel in control and pretty virtuous for not having stooped to the level of the other person.

## ADVERSITY EXERCISE

The sixth exercise is inspired by the Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, who in his book the Meditations wrote

- When you wake, say to yourself: “Today I shall encounter meddling, ingratitude, violence, cunning, jealousy, selfseeking; all of them the results of men not knowing what is good and what is evil. But seeing that I have beheld the nature and nobility of good, and the nature and meanness of evil, and the nature of the sinner, who is my brother, participating not indeed in the same flesh and blood, but in the same mind and partnership with the divine, I cannot be injured by any of them; for no man can involve me in what demeans. Neither can I be angry with my brother, or quarrel with him; for we are made for cooperation, like the feet, the hands, the eyelids, the upper and the lower rows of teeth. To thwart one another is contrary to nature; and one form of thwarting is 
  resentment and estrangement.”

There are several important things here. First, that we will encounter unreasonable, ungrateful, jealous, or selfish people is a fact of life. We should be mentally prepared for this to happen.

Second, those ungrateful, jealous, or selfish people are nevertheless our brothers and sisters in the human cosmopolis. And surely, we ourselves have at times behaved unreasonably. We should cultivate an attitude of understanding and forgiveness about others, just as we would like others to understand and forgive us.

Lastly, as Marcus says, it’s better for us to learn to work with difficult people. Since we don’t have the option of magically conjuring a world where everyone is nice and altruistic, the rational thing to do is to work with the people we have, not with those we wish we had.

If you know you will likely encounter difficult people today, spend a few minutes in the morning writing down your meditation on adversity. Make sure you write something in respect to all three of Marcus’s points.

What is the discipline of action?
Answer on page 181

# 第 7 课

## 与他人互动的斯多葛主义者

爱比克泰德为了更好的生活而提出的三项准则中的第二项是行动，这意味着我们应该与其他人互动，因为我们是希望被给予并值得同样尊重的人。本课中的每个练习都以引用古代斯多葛派之一的相关引言开始，然后是有关如何实践该原则的建议。

## 内心宁静的练习

第一个练习的灵感来自爱比克泰德的如下一段话，他在其中谈到了典型的 1 世纪罗马人去公共浴池的经历：

- 当你要拿东西时，提醒自己它是什么东西。如果你要洗澡，把洗澡时发生的事情放在你的脑海里——水倾泻而下，一些人被推挤，一些人辱骂，另一些人偷窃；如果你马上对自己说：“我想洗澡，**我想保持我的意志与自然和谐相处**”，那么在你做的每一件事中，你都会更加安全地工作。因为这样，如果有什么事情妨碍你洗澡，你就会说：“我不仅要洗澡，还要让我的意志与自然和谐相处，如果每次有人往我身上泼水，我就会崩溃，那么我就不会这样做了。”

如果你知道自己可能会遇到令人沮丧的情况，请在开始之前花一点时间在脑海中想象它。其次，在心理上排练诸如“我想这样做，但我也想与自然保持和谐”之类的事情。第三，想象自己在这种情况下表现得平静。

研究表明，这种技术之所以有效，部分原因是当我们在脑海中模拟某件事时，我们会激活与我们做实际事情时大脑中打开的相同的神经通路。这几乎就像大脑的进化正是为了帮助我们在问题发生之前先发制人。

## 时间的练习

罗马斯多葛派哲学家塞内卡在《论生命的短暂》中写道

- 你会听到许多被巨大的财富所累的人，有时在他们的委托人中间，或在法庭上诉状中，或在其他光荣的苦难中呼喊：“我没有活下去的机会。”你当然没有机会！所有召唤你的人，都让你远离你自己。......我说，检查一下，并回顾你生命中的日子。......每个人都匆匆忙忙地过着自己的生活，对未来充满向往，对当下感到厌倦。但是，一个把他所有的时间都用在自己需要上的人，一个把每一天都当作最后一天来计划的人，既不渴望也不害怕明天。

在古罗马，生活就像在 21 世纪一样，充满了**分心**和**无用**的事情。斯多葛学派的观点从这样一个观察开始：**人的生命是有限的，我们如何利用时间是至关重要的。**

对于这个练习，在一天结束的时候留出几分钟时间，画一张三列的表格。第一个将包含您已完成的一些活动。第二栏将回答您是否认为该活动使您成为更好的人或履行了重要角色的问题。最后一栏将回答您是否会在生命的最后一天这样做。

填写表格，然后进行盘点。有多少事情是令人满意的或重要的？如果今天是你生命中的最后一天你会做其中的哪些事？如果一项活动没有进入第二列或第三列，您可能需要重新审视它的价值以及是否要继续致力于它。

## 闲聊练习

作为第三个练习的开始，这里有一个来自爱比克泰德在 The Enchiridion 中的简单但难以实施的建议：

- 大部分时间保持沉默，或者，如果你说话，只说必要的话，用几句话。谈话，但如果有必要，就少谈，但不要谈论普通的事情，比如角斗士、赛马、运动员、肉类或饮料——这些话题无处不在——但最重要的是不要以责备、赞美或比较的方式谈论男人。

也许现在你不太想谈论角斗士，但爱比克泰德列出的其他事情仍然是很多闲聊的话题，比如在办公室、聚会或与亲密的朋友和家人交谈时。我们倾向于说太多，但很多时候我们并没有说很多实际上值得关注的东西。因此，**第一个概念是抑制我们说话的热情，而不管我们的说话质量如何。**

为了练习这个练习，你需要进行两个步骤。

首先，列出你经常谈论的话题，这样你就会知道你需要避免哪些话题。在你开始喋喋不休地谈论角斗士之类的事情之前，有了这个清单可以帮助你控制住自己。

其次，当你发现自己谈到清单上的事情时，在心里默念一个有效的提醒。例如，如果您发现与某个特定的朋友聚会时有八卦的倾向，请提前告诉自己，当你见到马克的时候，你会默默地告诉自己不要八卦。

你可能会遇到的一个困难是，你会感到一种强烈的心理压力，需要在社交场合说些什么以避免尴尬的沉默。但是停下来问问自己：沉默有什么令人尴尬的？张开嘴随意说话真的比安静地坐着听别人说话，甚至是沉默的声音更好吗？

## 美德练习

第四个练习也是基于 Epictetus 的 Enchiridion：

- 拒绝陌生人和粗俗的娱乐。但是，如果有机会接受它们，那么就要竭尽全力避免陷入庸俗的状态。要知道，如果你的同伴身上有污点，与他交往的人必须分担污点，即使他自己是干净的。

爱比克泰德所说的“庸俗”是指影响不好的人。这是一个严肃的观点，并且得到了现代实证研究的支持。如果我们想成为更好的人，我们需要远离那些强化我们坏习惯的人，相反，我们需要与那些通过他们的榜样来帮助我们改善的人为伍。

在实际操作中，下面是你可以做这个练习的方法。创建一个包含四列的表。

第一列将包含那些可能对您的美德不利的人。

在第二列中，写下您想要避免的以及您注意到的与特定个人相关的特定行为或情绪。例如，假设你试图减少你参与的八卦，但你的朋友马克真的很喜欢八卦。

> 假设您想戒烟。如果您与其他吸烟者一起出去玩，或者如果您花时间与已经戒烟并试图坚持他们新的健康习惯的人共度时光，您认为这种情况更有可能发生吗？

在第三列中，问问自己是否有可能在不回避社会责任的情况下减少与 Mark 的接触。例如，也许马克是你伴侣的密友，或者他是亲戚。这意味着你不能只是避开他，尽管你仍然可以找到减少曝光的方法。

最后一栏将包含您如何减少接触 Mark 的计划。如果能够做到这一点，它将包含一个积极的提醒——不管有没有马克——你真的想避免八卦。

请记住，您这样做不是为了成为势利小人，而是为了作为人类世界的一员而进步。现代科学表明它确实有效！

## 侮辱练习

在 Enchiridion 中，Epictetus 说

- 如果有人告诉你某某说你的坏话，不要为他的话辩护，而是回答：“他不知道我的其他缺点，否则他不会单独提到这些。”

从斯多葛派的角度来看，侮辱完全是对情感资源的浪费。关于侮辱的内容，只有两种可能：要么这个人批评你是对的，要么他们不是。如果他们是对的，不管有多粗鲁，他们可能已经表达了批评，你应该做的理性的事情是感谢他们指出了你需要改进的地方。如果他们错了，笑话就在他们身上，因为他们才是犯错的人。

你所能控制的只是你对感知到的侮辱的反应。在这段话中，爱比克泰德建议用一点幽默来应对，如果你能做到的话，这是很好的。然而，当别人侮辱你时，引起别人的反应恰恰是他们想要的。如果你直接走开，他们会觉得自己很愚蠢或愤怒。当然，那是他们的问题，不是你的。

要将这种洞察付诸行动，显而易见的事情是运用您已经学会的一些技术，例如提前考虑可能的微妙情况并在脑海中模拟您将如何反应。

请记住，一个有准备的头脑比一个措手不及的头脑能更好地处理问题。但是如果情况出乎意料地出现，你会尝试引导你内心的爱比克泰德思想，并做最简单的事情：走开。然后你会因为没有屈服于另一个人的水平而感到控制（自己控制了自己）和非常有美德。

## 逆境练习

第六个练习的灵感来自斯多葛派哲学家马库斯·奥勒留，他在《沉思录》一书中写道

- 当你醒来时，对自己说：“今天我会遇到多管闲事、忘恩负义、暴力、狡猾、嫉妒、自私；所有这些都是人们不知道什么是善什么是恶的结果。但是看到我看到了善良的本性和高贵，邪恶的本性和卑鄙，以及罪人的本性，我的兄弟，并没有真正参与同一个血肉之躯，而是同一个思想和伙伴关系与神一起，我不能被他们中的任何一个所伤害；因为没有人可以让我参与有辱人格的事情。我也不能生哥哥的气，也不能和他吵架；因为我们是被造的用于合作，如脚、手、眼睑、上下排牙齿。互相阻挠是违背自然的；挫败的一种形式是怨恨和疏远。”

这里有几件重要的事情。首先，我们会遇到不讲道理、忘恩负义、嫉妒或自私的人，这是不争的事实。我们应该为此做好心理准备。

第二，那些忘恩负义、嫉妒心强、自私自利的人，却是我们人类世界的兄弟姐妹。当然，我们自己有时也会做出不合理的行为。我们应该培养理解和宽恕他人的态度，就像我们希望别人理解和宽恕我们一样。

最后，正如马库斯所说，我们最好学会与难相处的人一起工作。由于我们没有选择神奇地创造一个每个人都善良和无私的世界，理性的做法是与我们拥有的人合作，而不是与我们希望拥有的人合作。

如果你知道你今天可能会遇到难缠的人，那么早上花几分钟写下你对逆境的冥想。确保你写了关于马库斯的所有三个观点的东西。
