## LESSON 5

## USING STOIC ETHICS TO ACHIEVE HAPPINESS

Ethics as a field of inquiry is conceived in radically different ways today compared to ancient philosophy. Modern ethics is, in essence, the study of right and wrong. Ancient ethics was the study of how to live one’s life. Appreciating the difference between ancient and modern conceptions of ethics is key to understanding how Stoic philosophy works and how to practice it.

## KANTIAN DEONTOLOGY AND UTILITARIANISM

If you look up the terms ethics and morality in a dictionary, you’ll see they’re used largely as synonyms, meaning something like “the standards that govern right and wrong conduct.” A moral, or ethical, person is construed as someone who tends to behave according to general standards of morality or ethics. An immoral person is one who fails to do so.

The two most common modern ethical frameworks are Kantian deontology\* and utilitarianism.

> Deontology means duty-based. The Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments, for instance, are deontological, articulating 10 universal rules of conduct.
> The words ethics and morality have revealing roots: the first from the Greek ethikos, relating to character, and the second from the Latin moralis, having to do with habits and customs. Moralis is how the Latin writer Cicero, one of the first philosophers of the Roman world, translated the Greek ethikos.

During the Enlightenment, the modern philosopher Immanuel Kant sought to establish morality on a rational, rather than religious, basis. He arrived at a single commandment known as the categorical imperative. It holds that we should strive to act according to how we wish everyone would act. For instance, if you are wondering whether lying is ethical or not, think of what the world would be like if everyone lied all the time. Civil intercourse would be impossible. So, lying is not ethical.

Utilitarianism was first articulated by Jeremy Bentham,
who lived from 1748 to 1832, and revised by his student John Stuart Mill, who lived from 1806 to 1873. Utilitarians think that what is right is whatever increases the happiness of most people, or whatever decreases the pain of most people.

Kantian deontology and utilitarianism both have their critics and supporters. Ancient Greco-Romans would have been puzzled by the whole notion that there can be a system of morals based on universal rules. Right or wrong behavior depends on the circumstances. Often, lying is indeed wrong, but it can occasionally be the right thing to do.

## VIRTUE ETHICS AND NATURE

The Greco-Roman approach—of which Stoicism is a prominent example—is known as virtue ethics. The focus is on the character of the person, not on individual actions. And the question asked is not whether a given action is right or wrong but rather whether the individual is improving as a human being.

Virtually all schools of Hellenistic philosophy say we should live according to nature, or following nature. But what does that mean? Here, the various philosophies differed. On one thing, however, they agreed: Living according to nature does not mean that whatever is natural is good.

Indeed, that notion is known in modern philosophy as an appeal to nature, and it’s considered a logical fallacy. If you think what is natural is good, then why do you go to a doctor when struck by disease? Why don’t you put poisonous mushrooms on your dinner table? Why do you seek shelter when a hurricane or earthquake strikes?

So, to live according to nature can’t possibly mean that whatever is natural is good. The true meaning is found in theories of human nature and the connection between science and ethics.

Consider the tomato plant. What counts as a good life for such a species? Any decent biologist, and a lot of people who grow tomatoes in their backyard, will tell you that tomatoes need a certain amount of water, nutrients in the soil, and lots of sunlight. They should also be shielded from parasites and herbivores. So, by understanding the biology of tomatoes, one is able to tell what counts as a good or a bad life for a tomato.

Humans are a lot more complicated than tomatoes, but we are biological beings nonetheless. At a minimum, we know that humans need food and shelter to survive. Still, surviving isn’t the same as flourishing. Here is where the various Hellenistic schools diverged in opinion. They put forth different theories of human nature, thereby giving different priorities to distinct factors that contribute to human flourishing.

## HUMAN NATURE

The Stoics thought that there are two major characteristics that, when combined, distinguish us from any other living species on the planet: We are highly social, and we are capable of sophisticated reasoning.

There are, of course, other social species. Ants, bees, and termites come to mind. But even though social insects are capable of sophisticated behaviors, they act more like genetically programmed automata than
beings endowed with volition. They do what they do without reflecting on whether it’s right or wrong.

Social primates, by contrast, are a different and more sophisticated class. Orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos are all smart animals. And primatologists have suggested that—at least in the case of the bonobos—they display the rudiments of moral behavior. They help each other, even among nonrelatives, and intervene when members of their group behave unfairly toward other members.

Still, there are no bonobo treatises on moral philosophy, or on any other subject matter. It is only Homo sapiens who are capable of interacting in sophisticated ways with members of their own species, particularly through language.

If this analysis is correct, and the Stoics are right that the two most important characteristics of our species are our sociability and our ability to think rationally, then we have a pretty good hint at what makes a human life good. In addition to such basics as food and shelter, we need to live in social groups to which we feel connected, and we need to use our brains to feel satisfied.

Given all this, what the Stoics thought begins to make sense: A good human life is one in which we apply our ability to reason to improve society at large.

## VIRTUE ACROSS CULTURES

How we translate living according to nature into everyday practice concerns Stoicism’s cardinal virtues.

A virtue is simply a behavioral disposition, which means that it’s a reflection of someone’s character. For instance, some people are prone to be generous, perhaps with their time or their finances. Generosity is a virtue, and it reflects well on the character of the person who offers it.

> There is scientific evidence to show that our brains get flooded with pleasure hormones whenever we’re able to apply our intelligence to solve a problem or discover a hidden pattern. That’s what happens when
> you solve a crossword puzzle, figure out how to fix the toilet, or accomplish anything else you put your mind to.

The opposite of a virtue is a vice. For instance, the opposite of generosity is stinginess. And nobody thinks that a stingy person has a good character.

Of course, things are not binary: There are degrees of generosity (or stinginess), and the same person may be more or less generous (or stingy) over time or depending on the circumstances. Still, we praise generosity and criticize stinginess, and we think the more consistently a person is generous, the more virtuous they are.

Nowadays, the word virtue is often associated with the Christian concept, which focuses on things like chastity, purity, and so forth. The Dominican friar Thomas Aquinas systematized Christian virtues in the 13th century. According to him, there are seven virtues, and four of them are the same cardinal virtues recognized by the Stoics: practical wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance. The additional three—faith, hope, and charity—come from Paul of Tarsus.

The Greek word used by the Stoics in this context is arete, which is often translated as “virtue” but more precisely means “excellence.” In an important sense, the Stoics are telling us that we should try to be excellent human beings, or the best human beings we can be.

Empirical evidence suggests that human cultures appear to universally recognize a small number of virtues, and that includes the Stoic ones. Psychologist Katherine Dahlsgaard and collaborators discovered six “core virtues” across a number of cultures and traditions: courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence.

Other than the four cardinal virtues, then, we have humanity and transcendence. However, humanity and transcendence are also found within the Stoic tradition, but they are not treated as virtues. Instead, humanity corresponds to the Stoic notion of cosmopolitanism—the idea that we are all brothers and sisters and should help each other. Transcendence in Stoicism is the notion that we are a part of the cosmic whole.

## STOIC CARDINAL VIRTUES

The four Stoic cardinal virtues are practical wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. This lesson now takes a closer look at each virtue using Plato’s dictionary of philosophical terms as they were used in antiquity.

Practical wisdom is the ability which by itself is productive of human happiness; the knowledge of what is good and bad; the knowledge that produces happiness; the disposition by which we judge what is to be done and what is not to be done.

The Stoics maintained that the only things that are truly good or bad for us are our own good or bad judgments, respectively. Everything else might have value, but it falls into the broad categories of preferred or dispreferred indifferents.\*\*

Plato defines the second virtue, courage, as
the state of the soul which is unmoved by fear; … self-restraint in the soul about what is fearful and terrible; being intrepid in the face of death; the state which stands on guard over correct thinking in dangerous situations; … force of fortitude in respect of virtue; [and] calm in the soul about what correct thinking takes to be frightening or encouraging things.

While we typically associate the word courage with physical bravery, especially in battle, the Stoics used the term with a moral connotation, particularly in the sense of having the fortitude to do the right thing.

> \*\* Indifferent, in Stoic lingo, doesn’t mean that we don’t care about it. For instance, health, wealth, and education are preferred indifferents. Correspondingly, sickness, poverty, and ignorance are dispreferred indifferents.

The right thing to do is the province of the third virtue, justice, which classically is defined as
the unanimity of the soul with itself, and the good discipline of the parts of the soul with respect to each other and concerning each other; the state that distributes to each person according to what is deserved; the state on account of which its possessor chooses what appears to him to be just; … social equality.

Notice that a just person is one who is at peace with themself. And this peace is reached precisely by our conscious work to achieve social justice by treating others fairly.

Finally, temperance is moderation of the soul concerning the desires and pleasures that normally occur in it; harmony and good discipline in the soul in respect of normal pleasures and pains; … the state by which its possessor chooses and is cautious about what he should.

Temperance is about self-control, of course, but particularly self-control applied to morally salient situations.

## DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL

The Stoic idea of the dichotomy of control allows us to translate the notion of living according to nature into a practical philosophy of life. This notion goes back to Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, but its most famous rendition is found right at the beginning of Epictetus’s manual of Stoic ethical advice, The Enchiridion.

Epictetus divides things into two major categories: what’s under our control and what’s not under our control. The first group includes our judgments, opinions, and values; the second group includes our body, reputation, career, and wealth, among other things.

Understanding the dichotomy of control means that, practically speaking, we should focus on the things that are up to us and accept the rest for what it is. That translates into internalizing our goals. We should concern ourselves with our intentions and efforts (which are under our control) and develop an attitude of equanimity toward outcomes (which are not under our control).

Do not worry about whether you will get that promotion at your job; do concern yourself with whether you’ve done everything possible to obtain the promotion. Do not worry about whether your spouse loves you; do concern yourself with whether you are a loving person.

The theory is simple, but practice is difficult. If we truly internalize the dichotomy of control, we will achieve a life of freedom, serenity, and happiness.

## 第 5 课

## 使用斯多葛伦理学来获得幸福

与古代哲学相比，今天的伦理学作为一个研究领域的构想方式截然不同。现代伦理学本质上是对对与错的研究。古代伦理学是研究如何过自己的生活。了解古代和现代伦理观念之间的差异是理解斯多葛哲学如何运作以及如何实践它的关键。

## 康德的义务论和功利主义

如果你在字典中查找伦理和道德这两个术语，你会发现它们在很大程度上被用作同义词，意思是“规范正确和错误行为的标准”。道德或伦理的人被解释为倾向于按照道德或伦理的一般标准行事的人。不道德的人是不这样做的人。

两种最常见的现代伦理框架是康德的义务论和功利主义。

> 义务论意味着基于职责。例如，犹太-基督教十诫是道义论的，阐明了 10 条普遍的行为规则。
>
> 伦理和道德这两个词有显着的根源：第一个来自希腊的 ethikos，与性格有关，第二个来自拉丁语的moralis，与习惯和习俗有关。 Moralis 是拉丁作家西塞罗（罗马世界的第一批哲学家之一）翻译希腊 ethikos 的方式。

在启蒙运动期间，现代哲学家伊曼纽尔·康德试图在理性而非宗教的基础上建立道德。他得出了一条被称为绝对命令的戒律。他认为，我们应该努力按照我们希望每个人的行为方式行事。例如，如果你想知道说谎是否合乎道德，想想如果每个人都在撒谎，世界会是什么样子——人们之间的交往将是不可能的。所以说谎是不道德的。

功利主义首先由杰里米·边沁（Jeremy Bentham）提出，他生活在 1748 年到 1832 年，并由他的学生约翰·斯图尔特·米尔（John Stuart Mill）修订，他生活在从 1806 年到 1873 年。功利主义者认为，正确的是增加大多数人的幸福，或减少大多数人的痛苦。

康德的道义论和功利主义都有批评者和支持者。古希腊罗马人可能会对这样一个概念感到困惑，即可以存在一个基于普遍规则的道德体系。正确或错误的行为取决于具体情况。通常，说谎确实是错误的，但有时它可能是正确的做法。

## 美德、伦理与自然

希腊罗马的方法（即希腊罗马对伦理的看法）——其中斯多葛主义是一个突出的例子——被称为美德伦理。重点是人的性格，而不是个人行为。**所问的问题不是给定的行为是对还是错，而是个人作为一个人是否正在进步。**

**几乎所有的希腊哲学流派都说我们应该按照自然生活，或者顺从自然。但是，这是什么意思？在这里，不同的哲学是不同的。然而，在一件事上，他们一致认为：顺应自然并不意味着任何自然的东西都是好的。**

事实上，这个概念在现代哲学中被认为是对自然的一种诉求，它被认为是一种逻辑谬误。如果你认为天然的东西是好的，那你为什么要在生病的时候去看医生呢？为什么不在餐桌上放毒蘑菇？当飓风或地震来袭时，你为什么要寻求庇护？

所以，顺其自然不等于自然就是好的。真正的意义在于人性理论以及科学与伦理之间的联系。

考虑一下番茄植物。对于这样一个物种来说，什么才是美好的生活？任何体面的生物学家，以及许多在自家后院种植西红柿的人都会告诉你，西红柿需要一定量的水、土壤中的养分和充足的阳光。它们还应该远离寄生虫和食草动物。因此，通过了解西红柿的生物学特性，人们就能够判断出西红柿的好坏。

人类比西红柿复杂得多，但我们仍然是生物。至少，我们知道人类需要食物和住所才能生存。尽管如此，生存并不等于繁荣。这里是各种希腊学派意见分歧的地方。**他们提出了不同的人性理论，从而对有助于人类繁荣的不同因素给予不同的优先考虑。**

## 人性

斯多葛派认为，有两个主要特征，当它们结合起来时，可以将我们与地球上的任何其他生物区别开来：我们是高度社会化的，我们能够进行复杂的推理。

当然，还有其他社会物种（也符合这两个特征）。蚂蚁、蜜蜂和白蚁浮现在脑海中。但即使群居昆虫能够做出复杂的行为，它们的行为更像是基因编程的自动机，而不是被赋予意志的生物。它们做自己所做的事，从不反思是对还是错。

相比之下，社会灵长类动物是一个不同的、更复杂的类别。红毛猩猩、大猩猩、黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩都是聪明的动物。灵长类动物学家认为——至少在倭黑猩猩的情况下——它们表现出道德行为的雏形。他们互相帮助，甚至在非亲属之间，当他们的团队成员对其他成员表现出不公平的行为时，他们也会进行干预。

尽管如此，没有关于道德哲学或任何其他主题的倭黑猩猩论文（即倭黑猩猩不写论文）。只有智人能够以复杂的方式与自己物种的成员互动，尤其是通过语言。

如果这个分析是正确的，并且斯多葛学派是正确的，我们这个物种的两个最重要的特征是我们的社交能力和我们理性思考的能力，那么我们就很好地暗示了是什么让人类生活变得美好。**除了食物和住所等基本生活，我们还需要生活在与我们有联系的社会群体中，我们需要用我们的大脑来获得满足感。**

**鉴于这一切，斯多葛派的想法开始变得有意义：美好的人类生活是我们运用我们的推理能力来改善整个社会的生活。**

## 跨文化美德

我们如何将顺应自然的生活转化为日常实践，这关系到斯多葛主义的基本美德。

美德只是一种行为倾向，这意味着它是一个人性格的反映。例如，有些人倾向于慷慨大方，也许是在时间或财务方面。慷慨是一种美德，它很好地反映了提供它的人的性格。

> 有科学证据表明，只要我们能够运用我们的智慧来解决问题或发现隐藏的模式，我们的大脑就会充满愉悦荷尔蒙。这就是当你解决了一个填字游戏，弄清楚如何修理马桶，或者完成任何你想做的事情。

美德的反面是恶习。例如，慷慨的反面是吝啬。也没有人认为小气的人品格好。

当然，事情不是二元的：慷慨（或吝啬）有一定程度，随着时间的推移或视情况而定，同一个人可能或多或少慷慨（或吝啬）。尽管如此，我们赞美慷慨，批评吝啬，我们认为一个人越是慷慨，他们就越有德行。

如今，美德这个词经常与基督教的概念相关联，基督教的概念侧重于贞洁、纯洁等。多米尼加修道士托马斯·阿奎那在 13 世纪系统化了基督教的美德。据他说，有七种美德，其中四种与斯多葛派公认的基本美德相同：实践智慧、正义、勇气和节制。额外的三个——信心、希望和慈善——来自大数（圣经中的地名）的保罗。

在这种情况下，斯多葛派使用的希腊词是 arete，通常被翻译为“美德”，但更准确的意思是“卓越”。在一个重要的意义上，**斯多葛学派告诉我们，我们应该努力成为优秀的人，或者我们可以成为最好的人。**

经验证据表明，人类文化似乎普遍承认少数美德，其中包括斯多葛派。心理学家 Katherine Dahlsgaard 及其合作者在多种文化和传统中发现了六种“核心美德”：勇气、正义、人性、节制、智慧和超越。

除了四大美德之外，我们还有人性和超越。然而，在斯多葛派传统中也发现了人性和超越，但它们不被视为美德。相反，人类对应于斯多葛派的世界主义概念——我们都是兄弟姐妹，应该互相帮助。斯多葛主义的超越是我们是宇宙整体的一部分的概念。

## 斯多葛学派的基本美德

**斯多葛派的四种基本美德是实践智慧、勇气、正义和节制。**本课现在使用柏拉图的哲学术语词典仔细研究每种美德，因为它们在古代被使用。

**实践智慧本身就是一种能够创造人类幸福的能力。知道什么是好什么是坏的；产生幸福（快乐）的知识；我们判断该做什么和不该做什么的倾向。**

斯多葛派坚持认为，对我们来说真正好或坏的唯一事物分别是我们自己的好判断或坏判断。其他一切都可能有价值，但它属于偏好或不偏好的冷漠类别。

**柏拉图将第二个美德勇气定义为不为恐惧所动的灵魂状态； ……对可怕和可怕的事情在灵魂中自我克制；在死亡面前勇敢无畏；在危险情况下保持正确思维的状态； ……在美德方面的刚毅力量; [和] 冷静地思考什么是正确的想法是令人恐惧或令人鼓舞的事情。**

虽然我们通常将勇气这个词与身体上的勇敢联系在一起，尤其是在战斗中，但斯多葛派使用这个词具有道德内涵，特别是在有勇气做正确的事情的意义上。

> 冷漠，用斯多葛的术语来说，并不意味着我们不关心它。例如，健康、财富和教育是冷漠的首选。相应地，疾病、贫穷和无知是不受欢迎的。

**正确的做法是第三美德的领域，即正义，其经典定义为灵魂与其自身的一致性，以及灵魂各部分相互之间和相互之间的良好纪律；根据应得的分配给每个人的国家；其拥有者选择在他看来是正义的东西的国家； ……社会平等。**

**请注意，正义的人是与自己和平相处的人。而这种和平正是通过我们有意识地通过公平对待他人来实现社会正义而实现的。**

**最后，节制是对通常发生在其中的欲望和快乐的灵魂的节制。在正常的快乐和痛苦方面，心灵的和谐与良好的纪律； ......它的拥有者选择并谨慎对待他应该做什么的状态。**

节制当然是关于自我控制，但尤其是适用于道德显着情况的自我控制。（节制是自律的基本单位）

## 控制二分法

**斯多葛派关于控制二分法的思想使我们能够将顺应自然的生活理念转化为实用的生活哲学。**这个概念可以追溯到斯多葛主义的创始人 Citium 的芝诺，但其最著名的演绎是在 Epictetus 的斯多葛伦理建议手册 The Enchiridion 的开头。

Epictetus 将事物分为两大类：什么在我们的控制之下，什么不在我们的控制之下。第一组包括我们的判断、意见和价值观；第二组包括我们的身体、名誉、事业和财富等。

**理解控制的二分法意味着，实际上，我们应该专注于由我们决定的事情，并接受其余的事情。这转化为内化我们的目标。我们应该关注自己的意图和努力（在我们的控制范围内），并对结果（不在我们的控制范围内）培养一种平静的态度。**

不要担心你是否会在工作中获得晋升；请关注您是否已尽一切可能获得晋升。不要担心你的配偶是否爱你；关心自己是否是一个有爱心的人。

理论很简单，但实践很难。如果我们真正将控制的二分法内化，我们将获得自由、宁静和幸福的生活。
