## DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM STOIC ROLE MODELS

The goal of Stoic philosophy is to make us into the best, most ethical human beings we can be. This is accomplished by paying attention to what we do and making sure we arrive at the best decisions possible. But the ancient Stoics also recognized that people can fool themselves into justifying a  particular course of action that might be more convenient than ethical. We can counter this natural tendency to stray by choosing role models whose characters we can emulate.

## CATO THE YOUNGER

Cato the Younger is one person Seneca suggests as a role model. He was one of the most respected politicians and generals of the late Roman Republic.

One example of his uncompromising character, though almost surely apocryphal, is recounted by the Greek historian Plutarch. In the year 91 BCE, a family friend named Pompaedius Silo was said to be visiting the youth’s home when the boy improbably made critical remarks about Silo’s views on land reform.

This upset Silo so much that he grabbed the young Cato by his ankles and dangled him out of a window. Silo threatened to drop the youth unless Cato agreed that the land reforms Silo had endorsed were good for Rome. Cato allegedly just stared at his captor until Silo gave up, pulled him back, and said, “How lucky for Italy that he is a boy; if he were a man, I don’t think we could get a single vote.”

A few years later, a second episode that probably did happen is also telling. Rome had fallen under the control of a dictator named Lucius Cornelius Sulla after a bloody civil war. Sulla began a series of reprisals against his political enemies, killing scores of them and enriching himself and his friends with the profits from the sale of the victims’ properties. Cato, now a teenager, was often a guest of the dictator and witnessed some of these atrocities in person.

But one day, while returning home from one of Sulla’s horrific sessions, Cato asked his tutor why nobody got rid of the tyrant. The tutor told him that “men fear him more than they hate him.” Cato responded, “Give me a sword, so I might kill him and set my country free of slavery.” From that day on, each time they left home, the tutor apparently checked to see if Cato was hiding a dagger, just in case.

Later yet, as an adult politician and revenue official in the territory of Cyprus, Cato refused to engage in the usual corrupt and self-enriching behavior of Roman administrators. A saying developed in Rome that whenever someone wanted to excuse himself for not being as ethical as he might have been, he would say, “Well, not everyone can be a Cato!”

## CATO’S DEATH

The story of how Cato died is often mentioned by Seneca as the quintessential example of Stoic virtue and courage.

Cato joined Pompey the Great’s republican army against Caesar. Caesar would defeat Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BCE, but Cato collected the remainder of the rebel army and took a last stand at Utica, in modern-day Tunisia.

> Centuries later, Dante gave Cato a prime role in his narrative poem The Divine Comedy, having the Stoic stand guard at the entrance of the Mountain of Purgatory. As the poet put it, “What man on earth was more worthy to signify God than Cato? Surely none.”

In the final Battle of Thapsus in 46 BCE, the Caesarian legions, although outnumbered, nevertheless managed to defeat Cato’s republicans. And Caesar made clear that he wanted Cato captured alive so that he could use him as a political pawn. Cato had different intentions.

After a last dinner and conversation with his family and friends, Cato retired to his room to read Plato’s Phaedo, which recounts the last hours of Socrates’s life, also spent in philosophical conversation with friends.

Once Cato had finished reading, he picked up his dagger and tried to stab himself to death, though he failed due to an injury to his hand. Though he didn’t immediately die of the wound, Plutarch tells us he then “thrust away the physician, plucked out his own bowels, and tearing open the wound, immediately expired.”

Now, the idea of a Stoic role model isn’t that one needs to be ready to do the sort of things Cato did. Rather, the idea is to think of ordinary and extraordinary people we admire and to try to pattern our behavior on theirs—not literally, but in terms of striving to do the right thing. Cato is rather exceptional even from a Stoic perspective. That’s why Seneca also mentions Gaius Laelius Sapiens,* who was wise in public dealings and a staunch and reliable friend, as an ideal role model.

## ODYSSEUS

Not all Stoic role models were living people; some were imaginary, mythological figures. One was Odysseus, the Homeric hero who captured Troy with his famous wooden horse and then spent 10 years making his way home to his wife and son, with 
all sorts of obstacles thrown his way by the angry god Poseidon.

> Gaius Laelius Sapiens: Laelius was consul, Rome’s highest political position, in the year 140 BCE.

Odysseus—or Ulysses, as the Romans called him—embodied a major 
tenet of Stoicism in the obligation to cheerfully submit to one’s fate 
while at the same time showing that this doesn’t equate to quietism. 
That’s why Seneca and his fellow Stoics, Musonius Rufus and Epictetus, 
all commented favorably on the Odysseus legend.

Odysseus is a role model for the Stoics because he was committed to 
playing his roles in life while at the same time not confusing such roles 
with who he more fundamentally was. He was the king of Ithaca, 
a warrior on the planes of Troy, the captain of his ship during the voyage 
home, a faithful husband to Penelope, and an inspiring father to his 
son Telemachus. But he also seems to have had a moral purpose that 
transcended his individual roles. He was steadfast, loyal, determined, 
and courageous.

Another reason Odysseus was a favorite of the Roman Stoics is that the 
Stoic philosophers Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and several others had 
all been persecuted and exiled, just as Odysseus had been persecuted 
by the god Poseidon and exiled to a number of places. When Odysseus 
landed at Phaeacia, he was alone, naked, and shipwrecked. Yet by the 
time he left the island, he was wealthy, with a new transport back home.

Epictetus used Odysseus to illustrate his idea that we don’t have to spend 
all of our lives in a single place. Learning and respecting other people’s 
ways is very much in line with the Stoic notion of cosmopolitanism, 
which is the idea that all human beings are fundamentally deserving of 
respect simply by virtue of being members of the human cosmopolis.
NELSON MANDELA

A contemporary role model that fits the Stoic concept is Nelson Mandela, 
not because he was successful in his struggle to overthrow apartheid 
in South Africa—since the outcome was not under his control—but 
because of the way he went about it.

During 27 years in prison, Mandela struggled with a very common, 
and in his case understandable, type of unhealthy emotion: anger. 
He was angry because he was forced to waste a large portion of his life 
in confinement and because of the injustices his people suffered.

Lesson 21 Drawing Inspiration from Stoic Role Models

But Mandela decided not to act out of anger. 
Instead, he took the opposite path of 
understanding and reconciliation. He was aided 
by reading one of the foundational Stoic texts, 
Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. A copy was 
smuggled by fellow prisoners onto Robben 
Island, where Mandela was incarcerated 
for 18 of his 27 years in prison.

Mandela decided that he wanted South 
Africa to be a successful nation and 
that such a nation could not be built 
on the basis of hatred or revenge. In the 
beginning, he did things that his fellow 
inmates considered misguided, to put it mildly. 
For instance, he learned the Afrikaans language. 
He studied his oppressors’ culture. And he formed friendships with 
jailers to practice cooperation.

Still, Mandela’s approach was distinct from that of Gandhi in India. 
Gandhi had proposed to convert Hitler with charm. Mandela was too 
much of a realist for that. And Gandhi thought that rejection of anger 
necessarily implies pacifism. Mandela, like the Stoics, realized that nonanger does not mean nonviolence. Violence might be necessary, and even 
useful, when strategically deployed.

Mandela ultimately proved successful at overthrowing the apartheid 
government, and he became the first Black president of South 
Africa. Later, he went against some of his own allies in the African 
National Congress to continue a policy of broader cooperation 
and reconciliation.

When Mandela was accused of being too willing to look for the good 
in people, he responded, “Your duty is to work with human beings 
as human beings, not because you think they are angels.” This is 
a phrase that could have been uttered by the 2nd-century Roman Stoic 
Marcus Aurelius.

SUSAN FOWLER

Another role model for contemporary times is Susan Fowler, who is 
a modern Stoic. She grew up in the rural town of Yarnell, Arizona, as 
the second of seven children in a fundamentalist family. Her father was 
an evangelical preacher, and her mother was a homeschooler.

Fowler felt that her education was lacking and began to pay frequent 
visits to the local public library. She eventually picked up the writings of 
Plutarch and the Stoics, which she explicitly credits with directing her 
focus toward what she could control in her life.

Later, working as a software engineer, Fowler landed a job at a wellknown transportation company, where she encountered what she 
described as a pervasive culture of sexual harassment. In February 2017, 
she wrote about her experience in a blog post that went viral and led to 
external probes that confirmed Fowler’s accusations and resulted in the 
ousting of the company’s CEO.

As a result of her social activism, Fowler has received a number of awards, 
including being named one of the nation’s top business and cultural 
leaders by Vanity Fair and being featured on the cover of Time magazine’s 
Person of the Year issue.

In an essay listing books that shaped her life, Fowler included Marcus 
Aurelius’s Meditations, Epictetus’s The Enchiridion, and Seneca’s On 
the Shortness of Life. These are three major works of Stoicism that have 
survived since antiquity.
SPIDER-MAN

Just like the ancient Stoics picked Odysseus as a role model, modern 
Stoics can refer to another fictional character: Spider-Man. The Peter 
Parker principle, which states that “with great power comes great 
responsibility,” is in line with the Stoic notion that we have ethical 
responsibilities toward other human beings. We need to do the job of 
a human being, as Marcus Aurelius puts it, without waiting for utopia 
on earth, no matter how small our contributions may be.
150
Lesson 21 Drawing Inspiration from Stoic Role Models

The famous phrase about power and responsibility has a long history 
stretching from the French Revolution to British Parliament and 
even Winston Churchill. But in the case of Spider-Man, the phrase is 
attributed to Uncle Ben. It’s the very last thing Ben says to Peter just 
before he dies, and it sets the ethical framework for Peter’s evolution as 
a superhero.

Spider-Man is a reliable moral compass within the Marvel universe. 
Other superheroes are sometimes moved by motives that might not 
always be virtuous and may even do things that are morally questionable. 
Spider-Man, however, comes close to the Stoic ideal of always trying 
to do the right thing, helping others while treating them fairly and 
with dignity.

No matter who you choose as your own role models, identifying them is 
an excellent exercise in self-discovery. You are making choices about how 
to model your own behavior. In turn, your choices become the straight 
ruler against which you are able to measure and regulate your character 
and walk the Stoic path.
