# LESSON 4

## HOW STOICS  UNDERSTAND PROVIDENCE

This lesson looks at Stoic physics, exploring how Stoics think the world hangs together. It considers three interrelated notions of their metaphysics: materialism, cause-effect, and determinism.

## THE COSMIC ORGANISM

The ancient Stoics were pantheists: They believed that God is intrinsic to—and inherent in—the world around us. Stated otherwise, they believed that the entire universe is a living organism endowed with reason, or logos. And they referred to this living organism interchangeably as God or Nature. If the universe itself is God, then we are bits and pieces of God, and we, too, are endowed with logos, since we are capable of reason.

The Stoic understanding of Providence is very different from that found in the Christian tradition. For Christians, Providence is whatever God decrees will happen, according to his plans. These plans are inscrutable to mere mortals but nevertheless take mortals into account because God loves us.

The Stoics, in contrast, thought of our relationship with the cosmos as one of part-to-whole. If an organism needs to cross a muddy path in order to get where it’s going, it is the foot’s duty to get into the mud, however much it may dislike the experience.

The crossing of the muddy path isn’t something that happens for the benefit of the foot but for that of the organism. The only good thing from the point of view of the foot—if it could reason—is that it would appreciate that it’s doing something good in the greater scheme of things.

The view of the cosmos as an organism was common in antiquity, but it was first replaced by the Christian metaphysical understanding of the world and eventually by the mechanistic philosophy that underlies the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. With the work of Galileo and Newton, science began to think of the universe as a machine that works by following the eternal laws of nature.

That view, in turn, got upset by modern conceptions arising from Einstein’s theory of general relativity and from quantum mechanics. Our current best bet to articulate a coherent metaphysical view of reality is that—as the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus put it—everything changes.

Contemporary metaphysicians and fundamental physicists suggest there are no stable things in the world, only processes that change temporary configurations of matter into other temporary configurations. We never step into the same river twice because the river changes constantly. While this broadly corresponds to the Stoic view, we are certainly not going back to an organismal view of the world.

## MATERIALISM

The Stoics were materialists in the sense that they thought everything that exists is made of stuff, or what today we call matter. God falls in that category as well, since it is the same thing as the universe itself. The soul also is material and likely does not persist after we die but rather is recycled into the cosmos, just like the stuff that constitutes our bodies.

Even mental events are material things for the Stoics. Consider, for instance, what they called impressions: mental events that can be triggered by the perception of an external object or by internal mental processes. An example of a perception-based impression would be your conclusion that it would be good to have some of that chocolate gelato you’ve just seen in the window of a shop. Conversely, an internally generated impression would be the thought that the square root of nine is three.

In both cases, according to the Stoics, your soul is being physically imprinted with an impression. Today, we would say that a mental event is instantiated by a particular chemical or electrical stimulation in the brain. And, of course, we do think that the brain, chemical substances, and electrical impulses are made of matter or energy. Since energy is just another form of matter, we agree that mental events are material in nature.

Even if we agree that thoughts are made possible by material substances, such as our brains, clearly some things are immaterial. We tend to think that the highest metaphysical category is existence: Things either exist or they don’t. Gelato exists, but mathematical concepts present a problem. The square root of nine is an immaterial concept, not a physical object.

According to some modern metaphysicians and philosophers of mathematics, mathematical concepts do exist independently of our thinking about them. This view is called mathematical Platonism, and it holds that mathematicians do not invent concepts but rather discover them. It’s analogous, in a way, to how astronomers discover planets. Another group of metaphysicians and philosophers of mathematics, by contrast, thinks that mathematical concepts are human inventions.

The Stoics provided a different view. They denied that existence is the highest metaphysical category. That privilege belongs to something they called ti in Greek, which roughly translates as “reality.” Reality, in turn, consists of the somata (corporeals) and the asomata (incorporeals).

The incorporeals do not exist but nonetheless are part of reality—like mathematical objects, for instance. Incorporeals have to be real, otherwise they could not be the object of thought. But they cannot exist, because they are not made of stuff.

> The ancient Stoics thought that the seat of the soul was the heart. We would say today that the seat of the mind is the brain.

## CAUSE-EFFECT

How do we know if something belongs to the category of corporeals or incorporeals? That’s where the concept of universal cause-effect comes into play. The ancient Stoics thought that the only things that can properly be said to exist are those that have the power to act causally on other things.

Thoughts do have power, since they can bring about action. For instance, in the case of the gelato, you might decide to go into the shop and buy some. The gelato itself has causal powers: It can cause a pleasurable sensation when you eat it. But the square root of nine does not have causal powers. That’s why it doesn’t exist, though it is real, since we can think it.

Understood this way, exist takes on two different meanings. For this reason, the Stoics came up with two different terms for what constitutes reality: things that exist and things that subsist.\*

The Stoics thought that cause-effect relations permeate the cosmos, affecting everything. They distinguished between different kinds of causes, or different degrees of causality. There are, for instance, universal causes, like the laws of nature that move the entire cosmos. Then there are more local causes that affect only a small portion of the cosmic web. The universe will go on as before regardless of whether you buy the gelato or not.

There are also co-causes. If you walk past a gelato shop and decide to buy a cone, there must have been additional co-causes—plenty of people walk in front of gelato displays without automatically buying some. You might have passed by the shop because you’re taking a different route home than normal due to a strike affecting the subway system. Or you might have been feeling a bit down that day because of something that happened at work, so you yielded to the temptation of chocolate gelato more readily than you would have otherwise.

All of these are co-causes that result in you eating gelato. Some are external to you, like the strike that made it impossible to use the subway. Some are internal, like the propensity to seek comfort food when upset.

> subsist: The corporeals can be said to exist, while the incorporeals subsist.

## DETERMINISM

The Stoic logician Chrysippus came up with the notion that there are universal and local causes as well as a number of co-causes. And he realized that this distinction between internal and external causes is crucial to make sense of the human power of volition: our ability to arrive at judgments and make decisions.

You’ve likely heard of this concept under the misleading term free will. This refers to the notion—rooted in Christian theology—that our will can be contra-causal, or independent of external causes.

If we agree with the Stoics—and with modern physics—that everything has a cause, then the ability to make decisions independently of external causes is a violation of the laws of nature.

Chrysippus used an interesting analogy to explain the Stoic position on volition. He started from the notion that if everything is caused by something else, then we live in what modern metaphysicians call a deterministic universe. Causes determine effects, and effects are determined by causes.

To make sense of this, Chrysippus invited us to consider a cylinder resting on a flat surface. If you push the cylinder, it will roll. If asked why the cylinder is rolling, you might be tempted to answer, “because I pushed it.” But that’s only part of the story. The cylinder also rolled because it’s in the nature of cylinders to roll. Had it been a cube, it would have flipped, or stayed still, but not rolled. So the rolling of the cylinder is co-caused by an external event—the push—and by the internal constitution of the cylinder itself.

> independent of external causes: For Christians, this notion is important because it’s a defense against the argument from evil, which goes something like this: If
> God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and benevolent, how can there be evil in the world? The answer is that God gave us free will, so we are the ones responsible for the evil.

The same goes for volition, known in ancient Greek as prohairesis. Whenever you make a decision, no exception to the cosmic web of cause-effect takes place. But some of the co-causes are internal and are the result of your character. Your character, in turn, can be molded over by external events and internal dynamics. Indeed, one could see the whole point of Stoic training as a way to refine our prohairesis—our faculty of judgment.

It’s in this sense that our judgments, values, and decisions are truly our own. Things don’t just happen to us. We’re not puppets pushed by external causes. We are part and parcel of the web of cause-effect. We play an active role in it.

## STOIC PHYSICS AND MODERN SCIENCE

For all their agreement, there are some tensions between the Stoics’ view of the cosmos and the modern scientific take. The contemporary scientific outlook accepts the notions of materialism, universal cause-effect, and determinism, but there are some caveats. A bigger divergence concerns the Stoic idea that the cosmos is a living organism endowed with reason, something that seems to be entirely at odds with modern science.

Modern science does accept the notion of materialism—that everything is made of stuff. The caveat lies in what, exactly, we mean by matter. Einstein famously showed with his theory of special relativity that there is an equivalency between matter (or, more exactly, mass) and energy. More recent developments hint at the possibility that what we call matter is not fundamental but emerges from the effect of the Higgs boson. So, the Stoic position remains acceptable only if matter is whatever physicists establish as the most fundamental constituent of the world.

> We play an active role in it: This position, referred to as compatibilism, is still very popular among modern philosophers.

The principle of cause-effect is still considered universal in science, despite the fact that philosophers have debated for a long time what the relation of cause and effect is. Philosophical discussions aside, the notion of causality is a fundamental concept of physics as well as chemistry, biology, geology, and other sciences. While we may not truly understand the deep nature of the cause-effect relation, it seems that the concept is here to stay.

People often object to the notion that we live in a deterministic universe by invoking quantum mechanics and the alleged fundamental randomness of quantum events. Quantum mechanics is a mathematical formalism used to describe the motions and interactions of subatomic particles, but whether these interactions are random or rigidly determined is unknown. But the equations that constitute the backbone of quantum mechanical theory are themselves deterministic, meaning they have analytical solutions. So, if these equations describe the behavior of the universe—and they certainly do—then, at least in that sense, the universe is deterministic.

Most importantly, however, the Stoics simply meant that things unfold according to cause and effect. Suppose that the relation of cause-effect holds probabilistically, as some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest. Cause-effect is still a crucial notion in science, and so is determinism. Science and Stoicism are therefore compatible in this respect.

Finally, if, on the basis of modern science, we discard the notion that the cosmos is a living organism endowed with reason, it would seem that the Stoic concept of Providence should also be discarded. This conception of Providence says that things happen for the benefit of the cosmic organism. We are part of the cosmic organism, which is why we should be happy to do whatever helps the cosmos, regardless of how unpleasant it may be for us.

But nowadays, we don’t think that the universe is a living organism that does what is good for itself. This means that if something unpleasant happens to us, we don’t have the comfort of thinking of ourselves as a foot that is stepping in the mud for the benefit of the larger organism. When we step in the mud, it’s just bad luck. And it doesn’t feel good.

Does this mean that Stoicism has become untenable as a philosophy of life? Not if we sensibly update it, bringing it up to speed with modern science in a coherent fashion, without completely upsetting the original system.

It turns out that not only can this be done, but the ancient Stoics themselves hinted in that direction. They knew they didn’t possess ultimate knowledge. The Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, in several passages of his Meditations, explicitly considers the possibility that the Stoics got part of their metaphysics wrong. But he reminds himself that even if they did get some of it wrong, there is still much value in Stoic ethics.

# 第 4 课

## 斯多葛学派如何理解宿命

这节课着眼于斯多葛派物理学，探索斯多葛派如何认为世界是联系在一起的。它考虑了三个相互关联的形而上学概念：唯物主义、因果关系和决定论。

## 宇宙有机体

古代斯多葛学派是泛神论者：他们相信上帝是我们周围世界的内在和固有的。换句话说，他们相信整个宇宙是一个被赋予理性或逻各斯（Logos）的有机体。他们将这种生物体交替称为上帝或自然。如果宇宙本身就是上帝，那么我们就是上帝的一点一滴，我们也被赋予了逻各斯，因为我们有理性的能力。

斯多葛派对普罗维登斯的理解与基督教传统中的理解非常不同。对于基督徒来说，天意就是上帝根据他的计划所规定的一切。这些计划对于凡人来说是难以理解的，但仍然考虑到凡人，因为上帝爱我们。

相比之下，**斯多葛派认为我们与宇宙的关系是部分对整体的关系。如果一个有机体需要穿过泥泞的小路才能到达它要去的地方，脚有责任进入泥泞，无论它多么不喜欢这种体验。**

穿越泥泞的道路不是为了脚的利益，而是为了有机体的利益。**从脚的角度来看，唯一的好处——如果它可以推理的话——是它会欣赏它在更大的计划中做的好事。**

将宇宙视为有机体的观点在古代很普遍，但它首先被基督教对世界的形而上学理解所取代，最终被作为 16 世纪和 17 世纪科学革命基础的机械哲学所取代。随着伽利略和牛顿的工作，科学开始将宇宙视为一台遵循永恒自然法则运转的机器。

反过来，这种观点又被爱因斯坦广义相对论和量子力学产生的现代概念所颠覆。**我们目前表达一种连贯的形而上学观点的最佳选择是——正如前苏格拉底哲学家赫拉克利特所说——一切都在改变。**

当代形而上学家和基础物理学家认为，世界上没有稳定的事物，只有将物质的临时形态转变为其他临时形态的过程。我们从不两次踏入同一条河流，因为河流不断变化。虽然这大致符合斯多葛派的观点，但我们当然不会回到有机体的世界观。

## 唯物主义

斯多葛派是唯物主义者，因为他们认为存在的一切都是由物质构成的，或者我们今天所说的物质。上帝也属于这一类，因为它与宇宙本身是一样的。灵魂也是物质的，在我们死后很可能不会存在，而是会被回收到宇宙中，就像构成我们身体的东西一样。

对于斯多葛派来说，即使是精神事件也是物质的。例如，考虑他们所谓的印象：可以由对外部对象的感知或内部心理过程触发的心理事件。基于感知的印象的一个例子是你的结论，吃一些你刚刚在商店橱窗里看到的巧克力冰淇淋会很好。相反，一种内部产生的印象是认为 9 的平方根是 3。

根据斯多葛学派的说法，在这两种情况下，你的灵魂都在身体上留下了印记。今天，我们会说心理事件是由大脑中的特定化学或电刺激实例化的。当然，我们确实认为大脑、化学物质和电脉冲是由物质或能量构成的。由于能量只是物质的另一种形式，我们同意心理事件本质上是物质的。

即使我们同意思想是由物质（例如我们的大脑）构成的，但显然有些东西是非物质的。我们倾向于认为最高的形而上学范畴是存在：事物要么存在，要么不存在。 冰淇淋确实存在，但数学概念带来了一个问题，9 的平方根是一个非物质概念，而不是物理对象。

根据一些现代形而上学家和数学哲学家的说法，数学概念确实独立于我们对它们的思考而存在。这种观点被称为数学柏拉图主义，它认为数学家不是发明概念而是发现它们。在某种程度上，这类似于天文学家如何发现行星。相比之下，另一组形而上学家和数学哲学家认为数学概念是人类的发明。

斯多葛派提供了不同的观点。他们否认存在是最高的形而上学范畴。这种特权属于他们在希腊语中称为 ti 的东西，大致翻译为“现实”。” 反过来，现实由躯体（有形的）和躯体（无形的）组成。

无形体不存在，但仍然是现实的一部分——例如数学对象。无形体必须是真实的，否则它们就不能成为思想的对象。但它们不可能存在，因为它们不是由物质制成的。

> 古代斯多葛派认为灵魂的所在是心。我们今天会说，头脑的所在地是大脑。

## 因果

我们如何知道某物是属于有形的还是无形的？这就是普遍因果关系的概念发挥作用的地方。古代斯多葛学派认为，唯一真正存在的事物是那些有能力对其他事物产生因果作用的事物。

思想是有力量的，因为它能带来行动。例如，以冰淇淋为例，你可以决定去商店买一些。冰淇淋本身具有因果关系的力量：当你吃它的时候，它可以引起一种愉快的感觉。但9的平方根没有因果关系。这就是为什么它不存在，虽然它是真实的，因为我们可以想象它。

这样理解，存在就具有两种不同的含义。出于这个原因，斯多葛派为构成现实的事物提出了两个不同的术语：存在的事物和不存在的事物。

斯多葛派认为因果关系渗透宇宙，影响一切。他们区分了不同种类的原因或不同程度的因果关系。例如，有普遍的原因，如推动整个宇宙的自然法则。然后还有更多的局部原因，只影响宇宙网络的一小部分。无论您是否购买冰淇淋，宇宙都会像以前一样继续存在。

还有共因。如果你路过一家冰淇淋店并决定买一个蛋筒，肯定有其他共同原因——很多人走到冰淇淋展示台前，却没有自动购买一些。您可能路过这家商店，因为罢工影响了地铁系统，您选择的回家路线与平时不同。或者你那天可能因为工作中发生的事情而情绪低落，所以你比其他情况更容易屈服于巧克力冰淇淋的诱惑。

所有这些都是导致你吃冰淇淋的共同原因。有些对你来说是外部的，比如导致无法使用地铁的罢工。有些是内在的，比如在心烦意乱时寻求安慰食物的倾向。

> 存在：可以说有形体存在，而无形体存在。

## 决定论

斯多葛派的逻辑学家克吕西普斯提出了一个概念，即存在普遍的和局部的原因以及许多共同原因。他意识到内部和外部原因之间的区别对于理解人类的意志力至关重要：我们做出判断和做出决定的能力。

您可能已经在误导性术语自由意志下听说过这个概念。这是指植根于基督教神学的观念，即我们的意志可以是反因果的，或独立于外部原因。

如果我们同意斯多葛派——以及现代物理学——认为一切都有原因，那么独立于外部原因做出决定的能力就是违反自然法则的。

Chrysippus 使用了一个有趣的类比来解释斯多葛派关于意志的立场。他的出发点是，如果一切都是由其他事物引起的，那么我们就生活在现代形而上学家所谓的确定性宇宙中。因决定果，果由因决定。

为了理解这一点，克吕西普斯邀请我们考虑一个放在平面上的圆柱体。如果你推动圆柱体，它会滚动。如果被问到为什么圆柱体在滚动，你可能会很想回答，“因为我推动了它。”但这只是故事的一部分。圆柱体会滚动，因为它具有滚动的性质。如果它是一个立方体，它会翻转，或者保持静止，但不会滚动。因此，圆柱体的滚动是由外部事件（推动）和圆柱体本身的内部构造共同引起的。

> 独立于外部原因：对于基督徒来说，这个概念很重要，因为它是对来自邪恶的论点的防御，它是这样的：如果神无所不知，无所不能，慈悲为怀，世上怎么会有恶？答案是上帝给了我们自由意志，所以我们是邪恶的罪魁祸首。

意志也是如此，在古希腊被称为 prohairesis。每当你做出决定时，宇宙的因果网都不例外。但有些共因是内在的，是你性格的结果。反过来，你的性格可以被外部事件和内部动力塑造。事实上，人们可以将斯多葛训练的全部意义视为一种改进我们的前发性——我们的判断能力的方式。

正是从这个意义上说，我们的判断、价值观和决定才是真正的自己。事情不会只发生在我们身上。我们不是被外部原因推动的傀儡。我们是因果网络的重要组成部分。我们在其中发挥积极作用。

## 斯多葛物理学和现代科学

尽管他们一致同意，但斯多葛派的宇宙观与现代科学观点之间存在一些紧张关系。当代科学观接受唯物主义、普遍因果和决定论的概念，但也有一些警告。更大的分歧涉及斯多葛派的观点，即宇宙是一个被赋予理性的活有机体，这似乎与现代科学完全不一致。

现代科学确实接受了唯物主义的概念——一切都是由物质构成的。需要注意的是，我们所说的物质究竟是什么意思。爱因斯坦用他的狭义相对论著名地证明了物质（或更准确地说，质量）和能量之间存在等价性。最近的发展暗示我们所说的物质可能不是基本的，而是来自希格斯玻色子的影响。因此，只有当物质是物理学家确立的世界最基本的组成部分时，斯多葛派的立场才可以接受。

> 我们在其中发挥了积极作用：这种被称为相容论（compatibilism）的立场在现代哲学家中仍然很流行。

尽管哲学家们长期以来一直在争论因果关系是什么，但因果原理在科学中仍然被认为是普遍的。撇开哲学讨论不谈，因果关系的概念是物理学以及化学、生物学、地质学和其他科学的基本概念。虽然我们可能无法真正理解因果关系的深层本质，但似乎这个概念仍然存在。

人们经常通过援引量子力学和所谓的量子事件的基本随机性来反对我们生活在一个确定性宇宙中的观点。量子力学是一种数学形式，用于描述亚原子粒子的运动和相互作用，但这些相互作用是随机的还是严格确定的尚不得而知。但构成量子力学理论支柱的方程本身是确定性的，这意味着它们具有解析解。因此，如果这些方程描述了宇宙的行为——它们确实如此——那么，至少在这个意义上，宇宙是确定性的。

然而，最重要的是，斯多葛学派只是意味着事物根据因果关系展开。假设因果关系在概率上成立，正如对量子力学的一些解释所暗示的那样。因果关系仍然是科学中的一个重要概念，决定论也是如此。因此，科学和斯多葛主义在这方面是相容的。

最后，如果我们在现代科学的基础上摒弃宇宙是具有理性的生命有机体的观念，那么斯多葛学派的普罗维登斯概念似乎也应该被摒弃。普罗维登斯的这个概念说，事情的发生是为了宇宙有机体的利益。我们是宇宙有机体的一部分，这就是为什么我们应该乐于做任何有助于宇宙的事情，不管这对我们来说有多么不愉快。

但如今，我们不认为宇宙是一个活生生的有机体，做对自己有益的事情。这意味着，如果我们发生了不愉快的事情，我们不会舒服地认为自己是为了更大有机体的利益而踩在泥里的脚。当我们踏入泥潭时，只是运气不好。而且感觉不太好。

这是否意味着斯多葛主义作为一种生活哲学已经站不住脚了？如果我们明智地更新它，以一种连贯的方式使其与现代科学同步，而不完全破坏原始系统，则不会。

事实证明，不仅可以做到这一点，而且古代斯多葛派自己也暗示了这个方向。他们知道他们没有终极知识。斯多葛派哲学家马库斯·奥勒留（Marcus Aurelius）在他的《沉思录》的几篇文章中，明确地考虑了斯多葛派在其形而上学的一部分错误的可能性。但他提醒自己，即使他们确实弄错了一些，但斯多葛伦理学仍然很有价值。
