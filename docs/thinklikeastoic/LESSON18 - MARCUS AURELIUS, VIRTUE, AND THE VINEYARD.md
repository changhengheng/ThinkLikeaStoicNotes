# LESSON 18

## MARCUS AURELIUS, VIRTUE, AND THE VINEYARD

Compiled and published as the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius’s personal diary provides us with, among other things, a splendid example of one of the most important Stoic practices: philosophical journaling, the habit of writing down and reflecting analytically on what we do and why.This lesson looks at some highlights of the next four volumes.

## THE STOIC SENSE OF DUTY

Marcus begins by exhorting us to rise willingly each morning to do the work of human beings, reflecting his typically Stoic sense of duty. There were things he didn’t want to do—like being emperor and fighting wars—but he understood this was his lot in life and acted accordingly. Following Stoic philosophy, we are all members of the human cosmopolis. Each of us is interdependent and benefits from everyone else.

He then writes, “Have I been made for this, to lie under the blankets and keep myself warm? But this is more pleasant.” This no doubt resonates with everyone who has trouble getting up in the morning. But Marcus reminds himself that pleasure is fine only so long as it doesn’t interfere with our obligations and commitments. It is our goals and projects that provide meaning to life, not an endless sequence of pleasures.

Marcus concluded by writing, “When someone has done a good act, they do not call out for others to come and see, but rather go on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”

The vine keeps on producing grapes without the need to be praised for it. Accordingly, we should do what’s right because it’s right, not in hopes that someone will commend us for it.

## MINDFULNESS

Stoicism is also a self-forgiving philosophy. Marcus reminds us of this when he says:

- Do not be disgusted, discouraged, or dissatisfied if you do not succeed in doing everything according to right principles; but when you have failed, return again, and be content if the greater part of what you do is consistent with human nature.

Only the perfect Stoic—a sage—never makes mistakes. And sages are rare. The Stoic philosopher Seneca said that sages appear at about the same frequency as the phoenix, the mythological bird that rises from its ashes.\* For the rest of us non-sages, continued effort is the path to improvement, even if we occasionally slip backward.

- According to Roman lore, the phoenix came back to life every 500
  years.

> Mary volunteers at the local soup kitchen. It comes naturally to say that her action is good because she’s helping others. But that conclusion focuses on the action itself, not on the agent who performs the action. A virtue ethicist would want to know why Mary volunteers at the soup kitchen. If she does it because she’s genuinely concerned with the welfare of the poor and homeless, then the action is virtuous. But if she does it only in order to add a line to her resume so that she can get a better job, then the action is not virtuous.

Marcus tells us how we can work toward becoming better human beings through a metaphor. He writes:

- Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that where a person can live, they can also live well; now it is possible to live at court, so it must also be possible to live well at court.

Marcus didn’t enjoy life at the imperial palace. He would have been happier to spend his time reading and discoursing with some of his mentors. But he reminds himself that the Stoics teach us that we can live well anywhere, because what we truly need—our character—is always with us.

Just as dye colors wool, so do our thoughts color our minds. This notion that we are what we think and that we change our habits of thought by repetition over time is common to other ancient philosophers, particularly Aristotle. And it finds good empirical evidence in modern times.

If you wish to follow the emperor’s example, be mindful of how you think, and nudge your thoughts in the right direction. Little by little, your mind will go there by itself.

## OBSTACLES

But a good life is not made just of proper thoughts; effective action is also required. Marcus tells himself:

- Our actions may be impeded … but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. … Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

We often encounter problems that appear to be like brick walls if tackled head on. But there are other ways to overcome these walls. We can go over them, under them, or around them.

Here, Stoicism comes close to the Eastern philosophy of Daoism, which famously includes the principle of de, meaning “responding by attuning.” The idea is that by training ourselves to respond to circumstances by adapting instead of resisting them, we attune ourselves to how the world works.

Daoist lore exemplifies the point through the legendary character of Dayu as he faced a potentially destructive flood. The natural thing for him to have done would have been to resist the flood with, perhaps, a protective embankment. Instead, Dayu worked to redirect the water, accommodating its natural flow. The channels he dug served as outlets and irrigated his farmland.

## OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION

One passage in book six of the Meditations is often cited as indicative of Marcus’s supposedly sour character, and more broadly as a demonstration of the inadequacy of Stoicism as a philosophy of life. He states:

- When you have savories and fine dishes set before you, you will gain an idea of their nature if you tell yourself that this is the corpse of a fish, and that the corpse of a bird or a pig; or again, that fine Falernian** wine is merely grape-juice, and this purple robe some sheep’s wool dipped in the blood of a shellfish;*** and as for sexual intercourse, it is the friction of a piece of gut and, following a sort of convulsion, the expulsion of mucus.

Should we conclude from this passage that Marcus disliked gourmet food, rejected excellent wine, and didn’t like sex? Quite the contrary. He was engaged in a standard Stoic exercise: redescribing things that we are a little too fond of in objective, neutral terms in order to distance ourselves a bit from our pleasures.

> ** Falernian was the best wine money could buy you in ancient Rome.
> *** The imperial color was Tyrian purple, which was obtained by soaking garments in the blood of a predatory sea snail.

Marcus had at least 12 children, and when his wife Faustina died, he took a mistress. So, he wasn’t averse to sex. He was also known to have a temper—something he actively worked to restrain all his life. He was probably reminding himself that even the imperial color was to be taken down a notch or two.

The point is to counter excessive emotional attachment to things with a bit of objective description so that we own our pleasures, not the other way around.

A bit later, Marcus tackles another human trait: the lust for fame. He writes:

- How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living at the same time and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised by posterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever will see, this they set much value on.

Here, Marcus observes that many people are obsessed with leaving an enduring legacy. But posterity is defined by future generations: people we do not know and never will know. Why be concerned about what they will think of us? Why not focus on the people who are alive right now and whose opinions may actually be of value to us?

Marcus continues on the topic of other’s opinions:

- If anyone is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no one was ever injured. But they are injured who abide in their error and ignorance.

This would be a welcome attitude in anyone, but particularly so in an emperor, with the disproportionate power he had over people’s lives. Stated otherwise, to the Stoics, ignorance is a defect.

## CHANGE

In book seven, Marcus tackles another recurring Stoic theme: the inevitability—and necessity—of change. Human beings have a natural resistance to change. We feel more comfortable with the devil we know. Change, particularly of the unexpected variety, throws us off, causing stress and anxiety. The Stoics believed this is because we fail to accept that change is both natural and necessary. Nothing good or bad would ever happen if things were not constantly changing.

The underlying metaphysics comes from one of the pre-Socratic philosophers, Heraclitus, who influenced Marcus. Heraclitus is famous for having said that we never step into the same river twice. A river is not a fixed object; it’s a dynamic entity. And so are we, as human beings, which means that we also are constantly changing.

Remember that for a Stoic, the only truly good things are those that improve our character, and the only bad things are those that undermine our character. Everything else needs to be approached with equanimity. Sometimes things go our way and the change will benefit us. At other times, the corresponding change will not benefit us. It is what it is.

This view of the world is liberating because it leads us to embrace change rather than resist it. Knowing change is inevitable will reduce our anxiety and nudge us toward a more serene existence.

## POSSESSIONS

A bit later, Marcus engages in a different meditation aimed at reinforcing his appreciation for his spiritual and material possessions. He writes:

- Think not so much of what you lack as of what you have: but of the things that you have, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them. At the same time, however, take care that you do not through being so pleased with them accustom yourself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if you should ever not have them.

Research in modern cognitive science shows that people tend to be miserable when they focus on what they don’t have. Yet we feel happy when we turn our attention to what we do have, especially as part of an explicit exercise in gratitude.

Marcus then directs his thoughts to how he would feel if he did not possess the best of the things he already has. This focus helps him to train his desire on those very things instead of new ones. And this comes from a man who could have had whatever he wanted, as emperor of Rome at the height of its power.

Lastly, Marcus reminds himself not to get too attached to his possessions. Fortune is fickle, and what it gives can just as easily be taken away. For this reason, Stoics—like Buddhists—aim at developing light attachments to things and even people. Everything is transitory. We should enjoy what’s with us and not experience regret when it’s gone. Nothing lasts forever.

## THE ART OF LIFE

Philosophy was perceived as the art of life in antiquity. The job of the philosopher from Socrates onward was to practice and teach this art to others. Even so, Marcus warned: “The art of life is more like the wrestler’s art than the dancer’s, in respect of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets that are sudden and unexpected.”

The reason life feels more like wrestling than dancing to Marcus is because we always need to be on guard. Life can throw us a punch at any moment, from any direction. This might sound bleak, but it’s a realistic view of things, even today.

Regardless of how lucky we might be—even surrounded by friends and family, with a fulfilling career, and in good health—we will, at some point, experience setbacks. An on-guard stance does not preclude us from enjoying life when things go well; it simply prepares us for the inevitable tumble so we can deal with setbacks as they occur.

Marcus continues with this pragmatism, writing,

- “A cucumber is bitter.” Throw it away. “There are briars in the road.” Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, “And why were such things made in the world?”

Don’t like bitter cucumbers? Don’t eat them. There’s no sense in complaining about the bitter cucumbers in the world. It’s a fact of life. Just accept it, and be grateful you don’t have to eat the cucumbers!

# 第 18 课

## 马可·奥勒留、美德和葡萄园

Marcus Aurelius 的个人日记以《沉思录》的形式编译和出版，为我们提供了**斯多葛派最重要实践之一**的精彩示例：**哲学日记**，**记录并分析我们所做的事情及其原因的习惯**。这节课着眼于接下来四卷书（第五章到第八章）的一些亮点。

## 斯多葛派的责任感

马库斯首先劝告我们每天早上自愿起来去做人类的工作，这反映了他典型的斯多葛式的责任感。有些事情他不想做——比如当皇帝和打仗——但他明白这是他的人生命运，并采取了相应的行动。遵循斯多葛哲学，我们都是人类世界的成员。我们每个人都是相互依存的，并从其他人那里受益。

然后他写道：“我生来就是这样的吗，躺在毯子下让自己暖和？但这更令人愉快。”这无疑会引起早上起床困难的每个人的共鸣。但马库斯提醒自己，**快乐只有在不干扰我们的义务和承诺的情况下才是好的。**是我们的目标和项目为生活提供了意义，而不是无穷无尽的乐趣。

马库斯最后写道：“当有人做了一件好事时，他们不会叫别人来看看，而是继续做另一件事，就像葡萄树继续按时结出葡萄一样。”

葡萄树不断地结出葡萄，无需为此受到表扬。因此，我们应该做正确的事，因为它是正确的，而不是希望有人会因此而称赞我们。

## 静观（MINDFULNESS）

斯多葛主义也是一种自我原谅的哲学。当马库斯说：

- 如果你没有按照正确的原则做每一件事，不要感到厌恶、气馁或不满意；但是当你失败了，再回来，如果你所做的大部分事情是符合人性的，你就会知足。

只有完美的斯多葛派——圣人——从不犯错误。圣人也很少见。斯多葛派哲学家塞内卡说，圣人出现的频率与凤凰(神话中从灰烬中升起的鸟)差不多。对于我们这些非圣贤的人来说，持续的努力是改善的途径，即使我们偶尔会倒退。

- 根据罗马传说，凤凰每 500 年就会复活一次。

> 玛丽在当地的施舍处做志愿者。很自然地说，她的行为是好的，因为她在帮助别人。但这个结论关注的是行动本身，而不是执行行动的代理人。一位美德伦理学家会想知道玛丽为什么会在施舍厨房做志愿者。如果她这样做是因为她真正关心穷人和无家可归者的福利，那么这种行为是有道德的。但如果她这样做只是为了在她的简历上加一句，以便她能得到一份更好的工作，那么这种行为就不是道德的。

马库斯通过一个比喻告诉我们如何努力成为更好的人。他写：

- 你的习惯性想法如何，你的思想性格也将如此；因为灵魂被思想所染。然后用一连串这样的念头来染色它：例如，一个人可以生活的地方，他们也可以生活得很好；现在可以在宫廷上生活，所以在宫廷上也一定可以过得很好。

马库斯不喜欢皇宫的生活。他会更乐意花时间阅读和与他的一些导师讨论。但他提醒自己，斯多葛学派教导我们，我们可以在任何地方过得很好，因为我们真正需要的——我们的性格——总是与我们同在。

就像染料给羊毛上色一样，我们的思想（thoughts）也给我们的心灵（mind）上色。其他古代哲学家，尤其是亚里士多德，普遍认为我们就是我们所想的，并且随着时间的推移通过重复来改变我们的思维习惯。它在现代找到了很好的经验证据。

**如果您想效仿皇帝，请注意您的想法，并将您的想法推向正确的方向。一点一点，你的心会自己去那里。**

## 障碍（OBSTACLES）

但美好的生活不只是由正确的思想构成；还需要采取有效行动。马库斯告诉自己：

- 我们的行动可能会受到阻碍……但我们的意图或性情不会受到阻碍。 ......因为我们可以适应和适应（ accommodate and adapt）。我们的思想会适应并将我们行动的障碍转化为它自己的目的。行动的障碍推动行动。挡路的东西就变成了路。

如果正面处理问题，我们经常会遇到看起来像砖墙一样的问题。但是还有其他方法可以克服这些墙壁。我们可以越过它们，在它们下面，或在它们周围。

在这里，斯多葛主义接近于东方的道家哲学，著名的道家哲学包括“德”的原则，意思是“通过协调回应”。其理念是，通过训练我们通过适应而不是抗拒来应对环境，我们使自己适应世界的运行方式。

道教的传说通过传说中的大禹面临一场潜在的破坏性洪水来说明这一点。对他来说，自然而然的事情就是用防护堤来抵御洪水。相反，大禹努力改变水的方向，以适应其自然流动。他挖掘的渠道充当了出口并灌溉了他的农田。

## 客观描述

《沉思录》第六卷中的一段话经常被引用为表明马库斯所谓的刻薄性格，更广泛地说，它证明了斯多葛主义作为一种生活哲学的不足。他说：

- 当你有美味佳肴摆在你面前时，如果你告诉自己这是鱼的尸体，是鸟的尸体或猪的尸体，你就会了解它们的性质；又或者，那美酒只是葡萄汁，而这件紫袍是羊毛浸在贝类的血中；***至于性交，就是一块肠子的摩擦，在一种抽搐之后，粘液的排出。

我们是否应该从这段话中得出结论，马库斯不喜欢美食，拒绝优质葡萄酒，不喜欢性？恰恰相反。他进行了一项标准的斯多葛运动：**以客观、中性的方式重新描述我们有点过于喜欢的事物，以便让自己远离我们的快乐。**

> ** Falernian 是古罗马钱能买到的最好的酒。
> *** 帝王色是泰尔紫，是通过将衣服浸泡在掠食性海螺的血液中而获得的。

马库斯至少有 12 个孩子，当他的妻子福斯蒂娜去世时，他娶了一个情妇。所以，他并不反对性。众所周知，他脾气暴躁——这是他一生都在努力克制的。他大概是在提醒自己，就算是帝王的颜色，也要降低一两个档次。

**关键是要通过一些客观的描述来对抗对事物的过度情感依恋，以便我们拥有自己的快乐，而不是相反。**

过了一会儿，马库斯谈到了另一个人类特征：对名声的渴望。他写：

- 男人的行为多么奇怪。他们不会赞美那些同时生活并与自己生活在一起的人；但为了让自己被后人、那些他们从未见过或将要看到的人称赞，他们非常看重这一点。

在这里，马库斯观察到，许多人痴迷于留下不朽的遗产。但是后代是由后代定义的：我们不认识也永远不会认识的人。为什么要担心他们会怎么想我们？为什么不关注那些现在还活着并且他们的意见可能对我们真正有价值的人呢？

马库斯继续谈论其他人的观点：

- 如果有人能够说服我并向我表明我的想法或行为不正确，我会很乐意改变；因为我寻求从未伤害过任何人的真理。但是，坚持自己的错误和无知的人会受到伤害。

这对任何人来说都是一种受欢迎的态度，尤其是在一个皇帝身上，因为他对人们的生活拥有不成比例的权力。换句话说，对于斯多葛派来说，无知是一种缺陷。

## 改变

在第七本书中，马库斯解决了另一个反复出现的斯多葛主义主题：**变革的必然性和必要性。**人类天生就有抗拒变化的能力。我们对我们认识的魔鬼感到更自在。变化，尤其是意想不到的变化，会让我们失望，造成压力和焦虑。斯多葛派认为这是因为我们无法接受改变是自然的和必要的。如果事情不是不断变化，就不会发生好事或坏事。

潜在的形而上学来自影响马库斯的前苏格拉底哲学家之一赫拉克利特。赫拉克利特以说过我们不会两次踏入同一条河流而闻名。河流不是固定的物体；它是一个动态实体。作为人类，我们也是如此，这意味着我们也在不断变化。

请记住，对于一个斯多葛主义者来说，**唯一真正好的事情是那些能改善我们品格的事情，唯一的坏事情是那些破坏我们品格的事情。**其他一切都需要以平静的态度对待。有时事情会顺其自然，改变会让我们受益。在其他时候，相应的变化不会使我们受益。就是这样。

这种世界观是解放的，因为它引导我们拥抱变化而不是抵制它。知道改变是不可避免的，这将减少我们的焦虑并推动我们走向更宁静的生活。

## 财产

过了一会儿，马库斯进行了一次不同的冥想，旨在加强他对精神和物质财富的欣赏。他写：

- **不要太想你所缺少的，而要多想你所拥有的：在你拥有的东西中，选择最好的，然后反思一下，如果你没有它们，你会多么渴望得到它们。然而，与此同时，你要注意，不要因为对它们太满意而习惯于高估它们，以免万一你没有它们时受到干扰。**

现代认知科学的研究表明，当人们专注于自己没有的东西时，他们往往会感到痛苦。然而，当我们将注意力转移到我们所拥有的东西上时，我们会感到高兴，尤其是作为表达感激之情的一部分。

然后，马库斯将他的想法引导到如果他没有拥有他已经拥有的最好的东西，他会有什么感觉。这种专注帮助他培养对这些事物的渴望，而不是新事物。这来自一个可以拥有任何他想要的东西的人，作为罗马的皇帝在其权力的鼎盛时期。

最后，马库斯提醒自己不要太执着于他的财产。幸运是善变的，它所给予的也很容易被夺走。出于这个原因，像佛教徒一样，斯多葛派的目标是培养对事物甚至人的轻微依恋。一切都是短暂的。我们应该享受与我们在一起的东西，而不是在它消失时感到遗憾。没有什么可以天长地久。

## 生活的艺术

哲学在古代被视为生活的艺术。从苏格拉底开始，哲学家的工作就是实践并将这种艺术传授给他人。即便如此，马库斯警告说：“生活的艺术更像是摔跤手的艺术，而不是舞者的艺术，就这一点而言，它应该随时准备好应对突然和意想不到的挑战。”

对马库斯来说，生活更像是摔跤而不是跳舞，是因为我们总是需要保持警惕。生活可以在任何时刻，从任何方向，给我们一拳。这听起来可能有些悲观，但即使在今天，这也是一种现实的观点。

不管我们有多么幸运——即使身边有朋友和家人，事业有成，身体健康——在某些时候，我们都会经历挫折。当事情进展顺利时，警惕的立场并不妨碍我们享受生活；它只是让我们为不可避免的跌倒做好准备，这样我们就可以在挫折发生时处理它们。

马库斯继续这种实用主义，写作，

- “黄瓜是苦的。”把它扔掉。 “路上有荆棘。”远离他们。这就够了。不要补充说：“为什么世界上会制造这样的东西？”

不喜欢苦黄瓜？不要吃它们。抱怨世界上的苦黄瓜是没有意义的。这是生活中的事实。接受它，并感激你不必吃黄瓜！
