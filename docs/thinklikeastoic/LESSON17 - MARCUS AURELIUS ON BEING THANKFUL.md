# LESSON 17

## MARCUS AURELIUS ON BEING THANKFUL

The 2nd-century Roman emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote one of the classical texts of antiquity, the Meditations, in the form of a private philosophical diary that probably was never meant for publication. While Marcus emphasizes a  series of practical mental exercises to help him cope with daily life, the text also features quite a bit of original philosophical analysis. This lesson examines the first four chapters, or books, of his Meditations.

## MARCUS’S REIGN

Marcus Aurelius was born on April 26 in the year 121 and died one month short of 59 years later. His reign was the last of the so-called Five Good Emperors—a period of stability and prosperity for the Romans. One thing these emperors had in common is that they 
chose successors who were capable in their own right rather than simply handing power over to their children.*

Marcus was long groomed for the imperial role. He was adopted by his predecessor, Antoninus Pius, at the behest of the emperor before them, Hadrian. He was schooled by a number of tutors, some of them Stoic philosophers, and he adopted the life of a philosopher at age 11.

> * This was not by choice, as four of the Five Good Emperors did not have natural children. The exception was Marcus, whose son Commodus became emperor and was eventually assassinated and declared a public enemy by the Senate.

Marcus Aurelius’s mastery of Stoic philosophy helped him to navigate a series of difficult situations during his reign, including two frontier wars, a rebellion by one of his generals, and a plague—probably smallpox—that killed millions throughout the Roman Empire.

## GRATITUDE

Chapter one of the Meditations is a long exercise in gratitude toward some of the people who influenced Marcus. At the top of the list are Marcus’s mother and grandfather. He writes:

- From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper. … From my mother [I learned] abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.

Marcus is grateful for having learned morality and self-control. Apparently, he suffered from a bit of temper, but he recognized it as particularly dangerous defect given the amount of power he wielded.

The mention of simple living and staying away from the habits of the rich is also important. Marcus was uncomfortable with court life, to the point that later on in the Meditations, he tells himself that a Stoic can live well anywhere, even in an imperial palace. Unlike several emperors before and after him, Marcus was not ostentatious.**

Marcus then thanks the Stoic philosopher Junius Rusticus, from whom he says he has learned to be easily “pacified and reconciled” with respect to “those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong.”

One recurring notion in Stoicism is that the wise person does not take offense. If someone says something negative about you, regardless of their intentions, it must fall into one of two categories: either the person is factually correct, or he is not. For the Stoic, a falsehood told about you by someone else is just air moving in your vicinity. It has no causal power to offend you, unless you let it.

One more person Marcus expresses gratitude for is Sextus of Chaeronea, a philosopher and the nephew or grandson of Plutarch. Marcus says, “From Sextus [I learned] to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration.”

Sextus’s view is that many people form opinions without much thought, so they’re the ones who should be embarrassed. Of course, the tolerance of an emperor with the power of life and death over others is admirable, and imagine how much better the world would be if we all practiced such restraint.

> ** Marcus used his own money to help Roman causes, as when he sold imperial property to help counter the devastating effects of the Antonine plague that struck Rome in the years 165 to 180.

## MEDITATION ON ADVERSITY

The second book of the Meditations opens with a statement that provides the basis for a common Stoic exercise known as the premeditatio malorum, or meditation on adversity. It goes like this:

- Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. … I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him.

First, Marcus reminds himself that we will likely encounter disagreeable people who wish to take advantage of us, are ungrateful for something we did for them, or are arrogant, envious, or unsocial. Since this is a factual aspect of human existence, we should not be caught off guard but rather accept it as part of the standard furnishing of our lives.

The idea for this exercise is to take a few minutes ahead of time to reflect on the possibility of unpleasant situations and people we are likely to encounter and prepare our minds to deal with them to the best of our ability.

To the Stoics, only things that undermine our character are evil, and only things that improve it are good. It’s up to us whether to engage in vicious behavior, which is bad for our character, or in virtuous behavior, which is good for our character. Envious, ungrateful, and deceitful people are simply unaware of what is good for them. Consequently, we should pity them rather than be angry with them.

Marcus also tells himself that he cannot be touched by unvirtuous behavior because he is in charge of his own behavior. Moreover, he wishes to keep in mind at all times that others, whether misguided or not, are his brothers and sisters. They are members of the great ideal human city, the cosmopolis, and deserve our respect and compassion as fellow human beings.

## SELF-REFLECTION

In the second book of the Meditations, Marcus writes:

- Failure to observe what is in the mind of another has seldom made a man unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.

For many of us, it comes naturally to pay attention to what other people think while spending little or no time in self-reflection. But Marcus points out that preoccupation with the opinions of others seldom brings us happiness, while lack of attention to our own thoughts is guaranteed to get in the way of our goals.

Marcus also tells us that we ought to live our lives with a sense of urgency, saying, “Since it is possible that you might depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly.”

We don’t know when we’ll die, and we tend to think it will happen later rather than sooner. But expectations about our longevity based on mortality tables are mere statistics. They’re no particular guarantee of anything. The point here is to live as if you have no idea when you’ll die, because you don’t! That being the case, do you really want to waste all those hours on bad television shows?

## DAEMONS

Near the end of the second book of the Meditations, Marcus writes:

- What then can guide a person? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within us free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy.

In pre-Christian times, daemon did not necessarily have a negative connotation. The Greeks and Romans recognized both good and bad daemons. In modern terms, a good daemon is our conscience.

Socrates used to go around saying that he had a daemon on his shoulder, and the daemon would advise him on what to do in difficult circumstances. When asked what the daemon’s most common advice was, Socrates said: “Don’t do it.”

In Marcus’s quoted statement, his daemon is telling him to not do violence to his conscience. He is to do what he deems right and not shameful. He should be superior to pain and pleasure, which doesn’t mean being incapable of experiencing them but rather handling them in the right way. He should be neither false nor hypocritical, and he should do nothing without a purpose.

In other words, we should live purposely and honestly, according to our consciences, and not as slaves to pleasure or pain. Pretty much all philosophies and religions of the world have converged on that recipe.

## VIEW FROM ABOVE

At the beginning of book three of the Meditations, Marcus veers toward a contemplation of death and its aftermath. He writes:

- Hippocrates, after curing many diseases, himself fell sick and died. … Alexander and Pompeius and Gaius Caesar, after so often completely destroying whole cities … themselves, too, at last departed from life. … And lice destroyed Democritus; and other lice killed Socrates.

Hippocrates of Kos***, the most renowned physician of the ancient world, lived from 460 to 375 BCE and died at the age of 85. As Marcus says, he cured many diseases, and yet he succumbed in the end because he was mortal.

> *** The Hippocratic oath of medicine, a  pledge to act ethically, is named after Hippocrates.

The Alexander to whom Marcus refers is Alexander of Macedon, known as “the Great.” Pompeius is the Roman general Gnaeus Pompeius, and the third individual Marcus names, Gaius Caesar, is none other than Pompeius’s contemporary and rival, Julius Caesar.

These were famous generals and conquerors who destroyed many cities and killed countless individuals. But they could not escape the final curtain: Alexander by disease at the age of 32, Pompeius betrayed and beheaded by those he deemed friends, and Caesar in a bloody conspiracy joined by his adopted son.

What Marcus is contemplating in addressing this list of ill-fated historical figures is an exercise in broadening his perspective. It’s what modern Stoics refer to as the view from above.

Whenever we get too caught up in our daily problems, we are urged to direct our thinking toward the larger expanse of time and the struggles of those who preceded us. The point isn’t that our problems are unimportant but rather that they should be considered in the wider context of human affairs.

The penultimate character in Marcus’s list is the ancient philosopher Democritus, who, despite his lofty vision of the cosmos, died from an attack of lice. The last entry is Socrates himself, who was killed by “another lice,” meaning envious and treacherous Athenians who condemned him to death on the charge of corrupting the youth of the city by teaching them what today we call critical thinking.

## ATARAXIA

One of the most interesting, and commonly misunderstood, passages of book four of the Meditations states: “The universe is transformation: life is opinion.”

Marcus isn’t endorsing moral relativism, in which anyone’s opinion is as good as anyone else’s. The Stoics firmly believed that some human judgments are right and others are wrong. Instead, Marcus is reminding us of two fundamental aspects of Stoic metaphysics, both of which have profound implications for how we lead our lives.

The doctrine that the universe is in transformation was originally espoused by the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who was a major influence on the Stoics. Everything changes; everything is impermanent. We should not get too attached to anything or anyone but rather tread lightly, thinking of people and things as not really ours, but rather as borrowed from the universe. And we should keep in mind that the universe can recall the loan at any time, for any reason.

What Marcus means by “life is opinion” could be that value judgments are not intrinsic in things or events themselves. Rather, they reflect human opinion. And human opinion is fallible. That suggests that we should always be on guard against our own judgments, especially if they are not the result of careful and critical reflection.

Combine the two ideas and you get the Stoic recipe for what they called ataraxia: a mental state of serenity, founded on an attitude of equanimity toward what happens to us. And that is what Marcus Aurelius kept striving for until the end of his life.

## CONCLUSION

Near the end of the fourth book of the Meditations, Marcus writes, “Remember, too, on every occasion that leads you to vexation to apply this principle: not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.”

Sure, life is going to test us on all this high-minded pretension of noble virtues and self-control. But when we face an unpleasant experience, or unpleasant individual, let’s not look at it as a burden. Instead, let’s think of it as an opportunity to make good on our self-discipline and values. Doing so becomes an affirmation of our own good fortune.

This sort of attitude is counseled by modern cognitive behavioral therapists and is a timeless recipe for turning ourselves from helpless victims of circumstances to resilient human beings capable of doing our best with whatever the universe throws our way.

# 第 17 课

## 马可·奥勒留论感恩

2 世纪的罗马皇帝兼哲学家马库斯·奥勒留（Marcus Aurelius）以一本可能从未打算出版的私人哲学日记的形式写下了古代经典著作之一《沉思录》。虽然马库斯强调一系列实用的心理练习来帮助他应对日常生活，但文本也有相当多的原创哲学分析。本课考察了他的《沉思录》的前四章。

## 马库斯的统治

马库斯·奥勒留出生于公元 121 年的 4 月 26 日，并在 59 年后的一个月内去世。他的统治是所谓的五位好皇帝（五贤帝）中的最后一位，是罗马人处于稳定和繁荣的时期。这些皇帝的共同点是选择有能力的继任者，而不是简单地将权力交给他们的孩子。*

马库斯早就为皇室角色做好了准备。在他们之前的皇帝哈德良的要求下，他被他的前任安东尼·皮乌斯收养。他接受了许多导师的教育，其中一些是斯多葛派哲学家，他在 11 岁时开始了哲学家的生活。

> * 这不是自愿的，因为五贤帝中有四位没有亲生子女。马库斯是个例外，他的儿子康茂德成为皇帝，最终被参议院暗杀并宣布为公敌。

马库斯·奥勒留斯对斯多葛哲学的掌握帮助他在他的统治期间度过了一系列艰难的局面，包括两次边境战争、他的一位将军的叛乱以及一场瘟疫——可能是天花——在整个罗马帝国造成了数百万人的死亡。

## 感恩

《沉思录》的第一章是对一些影响马库斯的人的感激之情的**长期练习**。排在首位的是马库斯的母亲和祖父。他写道：

- 从我的祖父维鲁斯那里，我学会了良好的道德和控制我的脾气。 ……从我母亲那里[我学会了]节制，不仅从恶行中，甚至从恶念中；此外，我的生活方式很简单，与富人的习惯相去甚远。

马库斯很感激他学会了道德和自我控制。显然，他有点发脾气，但考虑到他掌握的力量，他认为这是特别危险的缺陷。

提到简单的生活和远离富人的习惯也很重要。马库斯对宫廷生活感到不舒服，以至于后来在《沉思录》中，他告诉自己，斯多葛派可以在任何地方过得很好，即使是在皇宫里。与他之前和之后的几位皇帝不同，马库斯并不张扬。**

然后，马库斯感谢斯多葛派哲学家尤尼乌斯·鲁斯蒂库斯，他说，从他那里，他学会了很容易地“安抚与和解”，对于“那些用言语冒犯我，或者做错事的人”。

斯多葛主义中一个反复出现的观念是，**智者不会生气**。如果有人说你的负面的话，不管他们的意图如何，它必然属于以下两类之一：要么这个人在事实上是正确的，要么他不是。对于斯多葛派来说，别人告诉你的谎言只是在你附近移动的空气。**除非你允许它，否则它不会冒犯你**。

Marcus 还要感谢的人是 Chaeronea 的 Sextus，他是一位哲学家，也是 Plutarch 的侄子或孙子。马库斯说：“从塞克斯图斯[我]学会了容忍无知的人和那些不加考虑地形成意见的人。”

塞克斯图斯的观点是，很多人在没有经过深思熟虑的情况下形成了自己的观点，所以他们才是应该感到尴尬的人。当然，一个拥有生死大权的皇帝对他人的包容是令人钦佩的，试想，如果我们都这样克制，世界会变得多么美好。

> ** 马库斯用自己的钱来帮助罗马事业，例如他出售帝国财产以帮助对抗 165 至 180 年间袭击罗马的安东尼瘟疫的破坏性影响。

## 逆境冥想

《沉思录》的第二章开头有一段陈述，该陈述为一种称为 premeditatio malorum 或逆境冥想（对逆境的沉思）的常见斯多葛运动提供了基础。它是这样的：

- 从早上开始，对自己说，我会遇到爱管闲事、忘恩负义、傲慢、欺骗、嫉妒、不合群的人。所有这些事情发生在他们身上，都是因为他们对善恶的无知。 ……我不能被他们任何人伤害，因为没有人能把丑陋的东西固定在我身上，我也不能生我的亲戚的气，也不能恨他。

首先，马库斯提醒自己，我们可能会遇到讨厌的人，他们想利用我们，对我们为他们所做的事情忘恩负义，或者傲慢、嫉妒或不合群。**由于这是人类存在的一个事实方面，我们不应该措手不及，而应该接受它作为我们生活标准的一部分。**

这个练习的想法是提前几分钟反思我们可能遇到的不愉快的情况和人的可能性，并准备好我们的思想，尽我们所能处理它们。

对于斯多葛派来说，只有破坏我们品格（character）的东西才是邪恶的，只有改善我们品格的东西才是好的。是否从事对我们的品格有害的恶行或对我们的品格有益的善行，取决于我们。嫉妒、忘恩负义和欺骗的人根本不知道什么对他们有好处。因此，我们应该同情他们而不是生他们的气。

马库斯还告诉自己，他不能被不道德的行为所触动，因为他要对自己的行为负责。此外，他希望时刻牢记，其他人，无论是否被误导，都是他的兄弟姐妹。他们是伟大理想的人类城市——国际大都会的成员，值得我们作为人类同胞尊重和同情。

## 自我反省

在《沉思录》的第二章中，马库斯写道：

- 不观察别人的想法很少使一个人不快乐；但是那些不观察自己的思想活动的人必然是不快乐的。

对于我们中的许多人来说，自然而然地要注意别人的想法，而很少或根本没有时间进行自我反省。但马库斯指出，全神贯注于他人的意见很少能给我们带来快乐，而对自己的想法缺乏关注肯定会妨碍我们实现目标。

马库斯还告诉我们，我们应该带着紧迫感过我们的生活，他说：“既然你可能会在这一刻离开生活，所以要相应地规范每一个行为和思想。”

我们不知道自己什么时候会死，而且我们倾向于认为它会迟一些发生，而不是早些发生。但根据死亡率表对我们的寿命的预期只是统计数据。它们对任何事情都没有特别的保证。这里的重点是活得好像你不知道什么时候会死，因为你真的不知道！既然如此，你真的想把所有这些时间都浪费在糟糕的电视节目上吗？

## 守护神（daemons）

在《沉思录》第二本书的结尾，马库斯写道：

- 那么什么可以引导一个人呢？一件事，只有一件事，哲学。但这在于保持我们内心的恶魔不受暴力和伤害，高于痛苦和快乐，不做任何没有目的的事情，也没有虚假和虚伪。

在前基督教时代，daemons不一定有负面含义。希腊人和罗马人都承认好的和坏的daemons。用现代的话来说，一个好的daemons就是我们的良心。

苏格拉底过去常常说他肩上有一个daemons，daemons会建议他在困难的情况下该怎么做。当被问及daemons最常见的建议是什么时，苏格拉底说：“不要这样做。”

在马库斯引用的声明中，他的daemons告诉他不要对自己的良心施暴。他要做他认为正确的事，而不是可耻的。他应该优于痛苦和快乐，这并不意味着无法体验它们，而是以正确的方式处理它们。他不应该是虚假的，也不应该是虚伪的，他不应该没有目的的做任何事。

换句话说，我们应该根据自己的良心，有目的地诚实地生活，而不是成为快乐或痛苦的奴隶。世界上几乎所有的哲学和宗教都信奉这一方法。

## 从高处看（VIEW FROM ABOVE）

在《沉思录》第三卷的开头，马库斯转向了对死亡及其后果的沉思。他写到：

- 希波克拉底，在治愈了许多疾病后，自己病倒了，死了。 ……亚历山大、庞培和盖乌斯·凯撒，在经常彻底摧毁整个城市之后……他们自己也终于离开了生活。 ……虱子摧毁了德谟克利特；其他虱子杀死了苏格拉底。

科斯的希波克拉底***，古代世界最著名的医生，生于公元前 460 年至公元前 375 年，享年 85 岁。正如马库斯所说，他治愈了许多疾病，但他最终还是死了，因为他是凡人.

> *** 医学上的希波克拉底誓言，一种遵守道德的誓言，就是以希波克拉底的名字命名的。

马库斯所指的亚历山大是马其顿的亚历山大，被称为“大帝”。庞培是罗马将军格奈乌斯庞培，而第三个被马库斯命名为盖乌斯·凯撒的人，正是庞培同时代的对手，尤里乌斯·凯撒。

这些都是著名的将军和征服者，他们摧毁了许多城市，杀死了无数人。但他们无法逃脱最后的帷幕：亚历山大在32岁时因病去世，庞培被他认为是朋友的人背叛并斩首，凯撒在他的养子的帮助下参与了一场血腥的阴谋。

马库斯在解决这个命运多舛的历史人物名单时正在考虑的是扩大他的视野。这就是现代斯多葛学派所说的从高处看（VIEW FROM ABOVE）。

每当我们太沉迷于我们的日常问题，我们就会被敦促把我们的思想转向更广阔的时间和前辈们的斗争。问题的关键**不是我们的问题不重要，而是我们应该把它们放在人类事务的更广泛的背景下考虑。**

马库斯名单中的倒数第二个人物是古代哲学家德谟克利特，尽管他对宇宙有崇高的远见，但还是死于虱子的侵袭。最后一个条目是苏格拉底本人，他被“另一只虱子”杀死，意思是嫉妒和奸诈的雅典人，他们因教给他们今天我们所说的批判性思维而以腐蚀城市青年的罪名判处他死刑。

## **心平气和**

《沉思录》第四章中最有趣且最常被误解的段落之一说：“宇宙是转变，生命是意见。”

马库斯不支持道德相对主义，在这种相对主义中，任何人的意见都和其他人的意见一样好。斯多葛派坚信**人类的一些判断是正确的，而另一些则是错误的。**相反，马库斯提醒我们斯多葛派形而上学的两个基本方面，这两个方面都对我们的生活方式产生了深远的影响。

宇宙正在转变的学说最初是由前苏格拉底哲学家赫拉克利特所拥护的，他对斯多葛学派产生了重大影响。**一切都在改变，一切都是无常的。我们不应该太执着于任何事物或任何人，而应该轻描淡写，认为人和事物并不是我们真正的，而是从宇宙中借来的。我们应该记住，宇宙可以随时以任何理由收回贷款。**

马库斯所说的“生命是意见”的意思可能是价值判断不是事物或事件本身固有的。相反，它们反映了人类的意见。人类的意见是错误的。这表明我们应该时刻警惕自己的判断，特别是如果它们不是仔细和批判性反思的结果。

将这两个想法结合起来，你就会得到他们所谓的心平气和的斯多葛派秘方：一种宁静的精神状态，建立在对发生在我们身上的事情保持平静的态度上。这就是马库斯·奥勒留一直追求的目标，直到他生命的尽头。

## 结论

在《沉思录》第四本书的结尾，马库斯写道：“也请记住，在每一次让你烦恼的情况下，都要应用这个原则：这不是一种不幸，而是高尚地承受它是一种幸运。”

**当然，生活将在所有这些高尚的美德和自制力方面考验我们。但当我们面对不愉快的经历，或不愉快的人时，我们不要把它视为负担。相反，让我们把它当作一个机会，来实现我们的自律和价值观。这样做就成了对我们自身好运的肯定。**

这种态度是现代认知行为治疗师所建议的，并且是一个永恒的秘诀，可以让我们从无助的环境受害者转变为有弹性的人类，能够在宇宙给我们带来的任何事情上做到最好。
