# LESSON 3

## THE STOIC GARDEN: PHYSICS, ETHICS, LOGIC

Imagine tending a garden whose fruits you deem to be precious. At the very minimum, you would need a sturdy fence to keep out weeds and animals as well as fertile soil to grow beautiful flowers and nutritious fruits. That’s more or less the way the ancient Stoics thought of how to live the good life, using a number of metaphors to get their point across.

## COMPONENTS OF THE GARDEN

The fruits in the metaphorical garden are what the Stoics called ethics. Nowadays, ethics refers to the study of right and wrong. But in antiquity, ethics was nothing less than the study of how best to live one’s life. In addition to the ability to arrive at judgments concerning right and wrong, this encompassed ideas like what your goals in life should be and how you should relate to other people.

The fertile soil of the Stoic garden is physics, which encompassed science, metaphysics, and theology. To study physics, in other words, meant to try to get a grasp on how the world works. This is important, according to the Stoics, because if we embrace the wrong metaphysics, we’ll be likely to mis-live, since we would be living as if the world were different from what it is.

This is why the Stoics included a third component in the garden. The fence surrounding the garden represents good thinking to protect us from living according to nonsensical notions. They used the word logic, though this too had a broader meaning than it does in modern times. Early on, logic encompassed anything having to do with better reasoning, including formal logic but also cognitive science, rhetoric, and epistemology.

Good reasoning allows us to grasp the way the world is and leads us to navigate life in the best possible way. So logic informs both physics and ethics. And ethics, in turn, depends on both logic and physics.

## ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC

The Stoics were characteristically interested in what might be termed practical logic: the sort of thing that could be useful to everyone, right here and now. This can be contrasted with Aristotelian logic.

Consider a standard type of Aristotelian argument, known as a syllogism, consisting of two premises and one conclusion:

- All giraffes are animals;
- All animals are mortal;
- Therefore, all giraffes are mortal.

The general form of this argument is

- All A are B;
- All B are C;
- Therefore, all A are C.

The argument is valid, meaning that no matter what A, B, and C stand for, if the two premises are true, then the conclusion must logically follow.

This specific argument about animals and giraffes is also sound, which means that the two premises are, in fact, true. If an argument is both valid and sound, then the conclusion not only follows logically from the premises, but it’s also true.

This is not always the case. Look, for instance, at this argument:

- All giraffes are animals;
- All animals are blue;
- Therefore, all giraffes are blue.

It’s still formally valid, but the second premise—all animals are blue—is obviously false, which makes the argument unsound. The conclusion, therefore, is false, even though it follows logically from the premises.

Finally, Aristotle pointed out that there can be
arguments that are invalid, in which case the
conclusion does not logically follow, regardless of
whether it’s true or not. For instance:

- All giraffes are animals;
- All animals are mortal;
- Therefore, all animals are giraffes.

The formal structure of this syllogism is

- All A are B;
- All B are C;
- Therefore, all B are A.

An important thing to notice is that Aristotle’s syllogisms are concerned with the largest sets of a given class of objects: “all” giraffes, “all” animals, and so forth. That is, they are concerned with universal terms.

## STOIC LOGIC

Compare Aristotle’s syllogisms with a typical Stoic argument, made of propositions, which the Stoics called assertibles:

- If it is sunny this afternoon, then I will go for a walk;
- It is sunny this afternoon;
- Therefore, I will go for a walk.

The formal structure of the argument is

- If A, then B;
- A;
- Therefore, B.

This differs from Aristotle’s syllogisms in two important respects. First, the Stoics are concerned with propositions, not individual terms. Second, the structure of the argument is conditional: If something is the case, then something else will also be the case.

Moreover, the truth of the sort of propositions the Stoics were interested in may depend on circumstances. The assertible proposition “it is sunny now” may be true in the morning but false in the afternoon. And it will definitely be false at night.

We are rarely, if ever, concerned with statements about the kind of universal properties that interested Aristotle so much. But we are constantly engaged by conditional propositions.

> Aristotelian logic dominated the thinking of philosophers throughout antiquity and the middle ages and is still taught in introductory courses today. But while Stoic logic was known for many centuries, it began to be fully appreciated only in the early 20th century, with the pioneering work on propositional logic by the Polish logician Jan Łukasiewicz.

## STOIC EPISTEMOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY

The Stoics also developed a tightly integrated epistemology—or theory of knowledge—and psychology as part of their broader conception of logic. Their psychology was pressed in the service of accounting for how we arrive at decisions and why so often our decisions are based on incorrect judgments about the world.

A story found in Attic Nights, a book written by Aulus Gellius in the 2nd century, shows how Stoic epistemology and psychology are intertwined. Gellius speaks of a Stoic philosopher who has embarked on a sea voyage. Suddenly, a fearsome storm breaks out, and the philosopher goes pale, like every other passenger on the ship.

When the storm is over, Gellius asks the philosopher why he reacted to the danger in the same manner that everyone else did, since the Stoics say that the only truly bad thing is unvirtuous behavior. External events, like a storm at sea, are neutral—neither good nor bad. They just are.

The Stoic replies by getting out a copy of the fifth book of Epictetus’s Discourses, which explains the Stoic concept of impressions. An impression is the initial judgment we have of a sense perception. For instance, you see that a storm is battering the ship, and your impression may be expressed propositionally as “there is a storm out there, and this is a bad thing.”

The impression, then, is made of two components: the sensorial input, as in the case of seeing the storm in front of your eyes, and an immediate judgment—that the storm is a bad thing. As a result of these two components, your first reaction is automatic: You experience the physiological symptoms of fear.

But if you’ve trained yourself well as a Stoic, you can then gain what modern psychologists would call some cognitive distance from the automatic judgment. There is indeed a storm out there, but it doesn’t follow that this is bad. The storm just is. Any additional judgment needs to be examined and may very well be unwarranted.

> the fifth book of Epictetus’s Discourses: This work unfortunately does not survive in modern times.
> the physiological symptoms of fear: This first, automatic reaction is what the Stoics called a first movement of the soul.

The Stoic philosopher explained to Gellius that he—like any other human being—could not control the first motion of his soul, which is why he went pale. But then he examined the impression and said to himself: There is a storm out there, but since the storm does not affect my virtue, it is neither good nor bad. As a result, he was at peace with whatever would happen next.

This story implies that emotions are really two things. Take fear, for instance. There is the first movement, or the automatic physiological reaction to a perceived danger. This becomes a full-fledged emotion only once we add—implicitly or explicitly—a cognitive judgment: Not only do you feel afraid, but you really should be afraid, because something bad is happening to you!

This gives us the most powerful weapon in the Stoic arsenal. While the automatic reaction is not under our control, the cognitive component is. Therefore, we can challenge our own thoughts and train ourselves not to give in to irrational or damaging impressions.

## KNOWLEDGE

Knowledge—or episteme \*\*\*\* for the Stoics—results from the understanding of a systemic web of knowledge, or how everything is connected to everything else. It is not solely the result of perceiving individual facts and arriving at right judgments about those facts.

In a sense, the Stoics were empiricists. They thought that human knowledge ultimately is rooted in sensory experience. But empirical data through sense impressions is only part of the story, as our judgment plays a major role in forming opinions. Knowledge in the strict sense, moreover, is arrived at only when someone puts together sensorial experience, sound judgments, and a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the world.

> damaging impressions: This tool has been used to great effect over the past several decades by cognitive behavioral therapists.
> episteme: Today, the best approximation we have to the sort of knowledge the Stoics had in mind is what we call scientific knowledge.

The Stoics also acknowledged the existence of something we might call natural dispositions. Human beings, according to Epictetus, are naturally inclined to what the Stoics called virtue and what we would today characterize as pro-social behavior. This means that our notion of what is good begins with some innate disposition to interact constructively with other people, usually our caretakers.

Later on, experience refines this disposition, as we learn from the feedback we get from others when growing up. Finally, the use of reason allows us to make one more leap and consider abstract notions such as virtue, as well as to appreciate the fact that all human beings are fundamentally the same. That means that someone living on the other side of the planet has the same needs and wants, and should be accorded the same respect and dignity, as your friends and family.

Stoic logic, then, provides the basis for sound reasoning about the world and about ourselves. In turn, sound reasoning gives us a grasp of how the world works—the province of Stoic physics—and of how to live virtuously, the province of Stoic ethics.

# 第 3 课

## 斯多葛学派的花园：物理、伦理、逻辑

想象一下，照料你认为珍贵的果实的花园。至少，你需要一个坚固的栅栏来阻挡杂草和动物，以及肥沃的土壤来种植美丽的花朵和营养丰富的水果。这或多或少是古代斯多葛学派思考如何过上美好生活的方式，使用许多隐喻来表达他们的观点。

## 花园的组成部分

隐喻花园里的果实就是斯多葛学派所谓的伦理学。如今，伦理学指的是对与错的研究。但在古代，伦理学就是研究如何最好地过自己的生活。**除了判断对错的能力之外，这还包括诸如您的生活目标应该是什么以及您应该如何与他人相处等想法。**

斯多葛学派花园的沃土是物理学，它包含了科学、形而上学和神学。换句话说，**学习物理学意味着试图了解世界是如何运作的。**根据斯多葛学派的观点，这很重要，因为如果我们接受了错误的形而上学，我们很可能会错误地生活，因为我们会生活得好像世界与它的本来面目不同。

这就是斯多葛派在花园中包含第三个组成部分的原因。**花园周围的栅栏代表了良好的思想，可以保护我们免于按照荒谬的观念生活。**他们使用了“逻辑”（logic）这个词，尽管这也比现代具有更广泛的含义。早期，逻辑包含与更好的推理有关的任何事物，包括形式逻辑，但也包括认知科学、修辞学和认识论。

好的推理使我们能够把握世界的本来面目，并引导我们以最好的方式驾驭生活。因此，逻辑为物理学和伦理学提供了信息。反过来，伦理道德又取决于逻辑和物理学。

## 亚里士多德的逻辑

斯多葛派对可能被称为实用逻辑的东西特别感兴趣：这种东西可能对每个人都有用，就在此时此地。这可以与亚里士多德的逻辑形成对比。

考虑一种标准类型的亚里士多德论证，称为三段论，由两个前提和一个结论组成：

- 所有的长颈鹿都是动物；
- 所有动物都会死；
- 因此，所有的长颈鹿都是会死的。

这个论证的一般形式是

- 所有 A 都是 B；
- 所有 B 都是 C；
- 因此，所有 A 都是 C。

该论证是有效的，这意味着无论 A、B 和 C 代表什么，如果两个前提都为真，那么结论必须在逻辑上成立。

这个关于动物和长颈鹿的具体论点也是合理的，这意味着这两个前提实际上是正确的。如果一个论点既有效又合理，那么结论不仅从前提逻辑上得出，而且也是正确的。

但情况并非总是如此。例如，看看这个论点：

- 所有的长颈鹿都是动物；
- 所有动物都是蓝色的；
- 因此，所有的长颈鹿都是蓝色的。

它在形式上仍然有效，但第二个前提——所有动物都是蓝色的——显然是错误的，这使得这个论点不成立。因此，结论是错误的，即使它在逻辑上是从前提推导出来的。

最后，亚里士多德指出，有些论证是无效的，在这种情况下，结论在逻辑上是不成立的，不管它是真是假（即重点放在逻辑上是否成立，而无关现实是真是假，就算是真的，逻辑上也是不合理的）。例如：

- 所有的长颈鹿都是动物；
- 所有动物都会死；
- 因此，所有动物都是长颈鹿。

这个三段论的形式结构是

- 所有 A 都是 B；
- 所有 B 都是 C；
- 因此，所有 B 都是 A。

需要注意的重要一点是，亚里士多德的三段论关注给定对象类别的最大集合：“所有”长颈鹿、“所有”动物等等。也就是说，他们关心通用术语。

## 斯多葛逻辑学

将亚里士多德的三段论与一个由命题构成的典型斯多葛主义论证进行比较，斯多葛学派称之为断言：

- 如果今天下午是晴天，那我就去散散步；
- 今天下午阳光明媚；
- 所以，我要去散步。

论证的形式结构是

- 如果 A，则 B；
- A;
- 因此，B.

这在两个重要方面不同于亚里士多德的三段论。**首先，斯多葛派关注的是命题，而不是个别的术语。其次，论证的结构是有条件的：如果某件事是这样，那么其他事情也将是这样。**

此外，斯多葛派感兴趣的那种命题的真实性可能取决于具体情况。 “现在是晴天”这个可断言的命题在早上可能是正确的，但在下午可能是错误的。而且晚上肯定是假的。

我们很少（如果有的话）关心关于亚里士多德如此感兴趣的那种普遍属性的陈述。但是我们经常被条件命题所吸引。

> 亚里士多德逻辑主导了整个古代和中世纪哲学家的思想，今天仍然在入门课程中教授。但是，虽然斯多葛派的逻辑许多世纪以来是众所周知的，直到 20 世纪初，随着波兰逻辑学家 Jan Łukasiewicz 在命题逻辑方面的开创性工作，它才开始被充分理解。

## 斯多葛派认识论和心理学

斯多葛派还发展了一种紧密结合的认识论（或知识论）和心理学，作为他们更广泛的逻辑概念的一部分。他们的心理学被用来解释**我们是如何做出决定的，以及为什么我们的决定往往是基于对世界的错误判断。**

Aulus Gellius 在 2 世纪写的一本书 Attic Nights 中发现的一个故事展示了斯多葛派认识论和心理学是如何交织在一起的。 Gellius 谈到了一位踏上海上航行的斯多葛派哲学家。突然，一场可怕的风暴爆发了，哲学家脸色苍白，就像船上的其他乘客一样。

风暴结束后，格利乌斯问这位哲学家，为什么他对危险的反应与其他人一样，因为斯多葛派说唯一真正的坏事是不道德的行为。外部事件，如海上风暴，是中性的——不好也不坏，它们只是（如此）。

斯多葛派的回答是拿出爱比克泰德的第五本书的副本，这本书解释了斯多葛派的**印象**概念。**印象是我们对感官知觉的初步判断。**例如，你看到一场风暴正在袭击船只，你的印象可能会被命题地表达为“外面有风暴，这是一件坏事。”

因此，**印象由两部分组成：感官输入，例如看到眼前的风暴，以及立即判断风暴是一件坏事。由于这两个组成部分，你的第一反应是自动的：你体验到恐惧的生理症状。**

但是，如果你已经把自己训练成一个斯多葛派，那么你就可以获得现代心理学家所说的**与自动判断的认知距离**。那里确实有一场风暴，但这并不意味着这很糟糕。风暴只是如此（正在眼前存在着）。任何额外的判断都需要审查，而且很可能是没有根据的。

> Epictetus’s Discourses 第五本书：不幸的是，这部作品在现代没有幸存下来。
> 恐惧的生理症状：这首先是自动反应，斯多葛学派称之为灵魂的第一次运动。

斯多葛派哲学家向 Gellius 解释说，他和其他任何人一样，无法控制自己灵魂的第一个动作，这就是他脸色苍白的原因。但他又检查了印象，对自己说：外面有风暴，但风暴不影响我的德行，所以没有好坏之分。结果，他对接下来发生的任何事情都很平静。

**这个故事暗示情感实际上是两件事。以恐惧为例。有第一个动作，或对感知到的危险的自动生理反应。只有当我们隐含或明确地添加一种认知判断时，这才会成为一种成熟的情绪：你不仅感到害怕，而且你真的应该害怕，因为有不好的事情发生在你身上！**

这为我们提供了 Stoic 武器库中最强大的武器。**虽然我们无法控制自动反应，但认知成分却是受控制的。因此，我们可以挑战自己的想法，训练自己不要屈服于非理性或破坏性的印象。**

## 知识

知识——或斯多葛学派的认知——源于对系统知识网络的理解，或者**一切事物如何与其他事物联系在一起的**。这不仅仅是感知个别事实并对这些事实做出正确判断的结果。

从某种意义上说，斯多葛派是经验主义者。他们认为人类的知识最终植根于感官体验。但是通过感官印象获得的经验数据只是故事的一部分，因为我们的判断在形成意见方面起着重要作用。此外，**只有将感官体验、合理判断和对世界本质的全面理解结合起来，才能获得严格意义上的知识。**

> 破坏性印象：在过去的几十年中，认知行为治疗师使用该工具取得了巨大的效果。
> 认识论：今天，我们对斯多葛学派心目中的那种知识的最佳近似是我们所说的科学知识。

斯多葛派也承认存在我们可以称之为自然倾向的东西。根据爱比克泰德的说法，人类自然倾向于斯多葛学派所谓的美德以及我们今天所描述的亲社会行为。这意味着我们对善的概念始于与其他人（通常是我们的看护人）进行建设性互动的天生倾向。

后来，随着我们从成长过程中从他人那里得到的反馈中学习，经验会完善这种性格。最后，理性的使用使我们能够再飞跃，并考虑抽象概念，例如美德，以及理解所有人在本质上都是相同的这一事实。 这意味着生活在地球另一端的人与您的朋友和家人有相同的需求和愿望，并且应该得到同样的尊重和尊严。

因此，斯多葛派的逻辑为关于世界和我们自己的合理推理提供了基础。 反过来，合理的推理让我们掌握了世界如何运转——斯多葛物理学的领域——以及如何道德生活——斯多葛伦理学的领域。
